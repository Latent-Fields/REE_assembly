# Conflict: Care Override vs Other-Harm Veto

## Conflicting Claim IDs

- Q-009
- MECH-036
- MECH-051
- MECH-052

## Verbatim Excerpts (with preserved sources)

From `docs/architecture/social.md`:
> "Other-harm should trigger a hard veto only under high-certainty, catastrophic, or irreversible outcomes."

From `docs/architecture/social.md`:
> "Should high care-investment weights ever override other-harm veto thresholds ... ?"

## Why They Conflict (or What Would Reconcile Them)

MECH-036 sets a catastrophic-veto framing, while Q-009 asks whether care persistence and relational weights can
override that veto in edge cases to avoid paralysis. This creates an unresolved policy boundary between third-party
protection and care-driven action under constrained alternatives.

## Reconciliation Question

What formal threshold policy should govern overrides: never override catastrophic veto, or allow override only under
strict necessity/proportionality/imminence constraints with explicit accountability logging?
