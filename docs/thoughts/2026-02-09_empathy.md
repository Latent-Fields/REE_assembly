You can add that “other doing self-recognition” stream without inventing a whole social-cognition subsystem — if you treat it as an extension of the same self/world/impact machinery, but with a gated mapping that lets another agent’s state be partially projected into your self-stream space.

1) What the extra stream actually is

Add a tagged stream that is not “other” in general, but specifically:

OTHER_SELFLIKE = “this thing appears to be running a self–world separation and self-impact loop.”

It’s an agency-with-self-model detector, not just face/biological motion detection.

Minimal cues it can key on (architecturally, not perceptually):
	•	evidence of goal-directed intervention
	•	evidence of prediction (anticipatory adjustment, error-correction)
	•	evidence of self–world boundary maintenance (protecting body/limits)
	•	evidence of learning from self-caused consequences (reafference-like structure)

REE-wise: it’s detecting the signature of a control plane + efference copy + correction in the observed dynamics.

2) How to set it up in REE terms

You don’t need “mindreading” first. You need two pieces:

A) An “agency model” over WORLD
A latent that segments WORLD trajectories into:
	•	passive dynamics vs
	•	interveners (things that cause state transitions in structured ways)

Call the tag: AGENCY (derived stream, like TEMPORAL_COHERENCE).

B) A “self-like” classifier over AGENTS
For each detected agent, infer a probability that it has:
	•	stable internal state
	•	a body boundary (or equivalent)
	•	error correction under intervention

Call it: OTHER_SELFLIKE.

This can live alongside WORLD predictions: it’s just another inferred latent over the scene.

3) The fast-empathy mechanism

Fast empathy (your “compute the other along self streams”) becomes:

A gated projection from OTHER_SELFLIKE into a shadow copy of self-streams.

Create a shadow bundle of streams for each salient agent j:
	•	HOMEOSTASIS_j (estimated)
	•	HARM_j (estimated)
	•	SELF_IMPACT_j (estimated, in the sense of “their actions cause them consequences”)
	•	optionally TEMPORAL_COHERENCE_j (estimated)

These are not “true” interoception — they’re inferred viability variables.

Then introduce one key control-plane knob:
	•	\lambda_{\text{empathy}}: how much the agent’s estimated harm/viability is treated as if it were self-relevant in pruning and vetoing.

So harm pruning becomes (conceptually):
	•	effective harm = HARM_self  ⊕  \lambda_{\text{empathy}} · HARM_other

…and similarly (weaker weights) for HOMEOSTASIS and TEMPORAL_COHERENCE if you want “care” to include broader welfare, not only acute harm.

This gives you a true fast empathy channel without new primitives.

4) Where oxytocin fits as a control-plane control

Oxytocin-like modulation can be modelled as controlling:
	•	\lambda_{\text{empathy}} (other-to-self coupling strength)
	•	g_{\text{social}} (attention/gain to OTHER_SELFLIKE agents)
	•	\alpha_{\text{other}} (precision assigned to inferred other-states)
	•	and critically, the veto threshold coupling: whether other-harm can trigger interrupts vs merely influence ranking.

So you can implement:
	•	low oxytocin-mode: other-harm influences valence ranking a bit, rarely vetoes
	•	high oxytocin-mode: other-harm can veto (or near-veto), and increases scrutiny of trajectories that externalise harm

5) How this relates to surprise, approach/avoid, and safety

Once you have OTHER_SELFLIKE + \lambda_{\text{empathy}}, the rest becomes consistent:
	•	Surprise / novelty load: if an OTHER_SELFLIKE agent is surprising, that can:
	•	raise vigilance (increase g_S, \alpha_S)
	•	narrow rollout horizon H
	•	reduce rollout temperature \tau_{E2}
	•	Approach/avoid: you can let the control plane set differential gains:
	•	approach is enabled when SAFETY is high and ENERGY margin is high
	•	avoidance dominates when HARM urgency or surprise load is high
	•	Safety recognition becomes social too:
	•	“safe-with-others” vs “safe-alone” can be learned as part of the SAFETY stream, conditioned on OTHER_SELFLIKE presence and affiliation cues

6) The “basics” you need before you can do this cleanly

You’re correct that you might not have all basics yet. The minimal prerequisites are:
	1.	Self-impact attribution is already working (for self).
	2.	AGENCY segmentation exists (what in WORLD is an intervener).
	3.	A shadow-state mechanism exists (ability to maintain inferred latent bundles for “entities”).
	4.	Control plane can gate coupling (\lambda-style knobs that change pruning/veto behavior).

If you have those four, empathy is mostly routing + weighting, not a new cognitive faculty.

Proposed new tags and knobs (minimal additions)

Derived streams
	•	AGENCY (agentness / intervener detection)
	•	OTHER_SELFLIKE (self-model signature)
	•	OTHER_HARM (estimated harm-to-other; computed when OTHER_SELFLIKE is high)
	•	AFFILIATION (optional: familiarity/kinship/bond proxy to stabilise \lambda_{\text{empathy}})

Control plane knobs
	•	\lambda_{\text{empathy}}: other→self coupling
	•	g_{\text{social}}: social attention gain
	•	\alpha_{\text{other}}: precision on inferred other states
	•	v_{\text{other-veto}}: whether other-harm can trigger veto/interrupt vs only affect valence ranking

⸻

Abstracted language sketch
	•	Detect: WORLD → infer AGENCY(j) → infer OTHER_SELFLIKE(j)
	•	Construct shadow bundle: \tilde{S}_j = \{\widetilde{HARM}_j, \widetilde{HOME}_j, \widetilde{COH}_j\}
	•	Control: set \lambda_{\text{empathy}} (oxytocin-like)
	•	Prune: reject τ if HARM_{self}(τ) veto OR v_{\text{other-veto}} \land \lambda_{\text{empathy}}\widetilde{HARM}_j(τ) veto
	•	Rank: maximise vector VALENCE(τ) with weighted inclusion of \tilde{S}_j

Footnotes
	1.	This formulation keeps empathy inside your existing “prediction + pruning” story: it’s not a moral rule; it’s a coupling of viability accounting across agents.
	2.	“Oxytocin” here is used as a design analogy for a neuromodulator that increases social salience and other-to-self coupling; it’s not claiming a one-to-one biological mapping.
	3.	The hardest engineering piece is usually \alpha_{\text{other}}: deciding when inferred other-states are reliable enough to warrant veto influence (otherwise you get spurious empathy triggers or paranoia-like dynamics).
