basal ganglia systems

If
	•	hippocampus carries path traces (space–time trajectories),
	•	frontal systems hold them online and simulate,
	•	basal ganglia implement the commit gate,

then:

Where do pre-commit prediction errors live, and where do post-commit outcome errors live?

Let’s separate the layers carefully.

⸻

1️⃣ Pre-commit error: “Should I do this?”

This is error computed before threshold crossing.

It is about:
	•	Predicted value
	•	Predicted cost
	•	Predicted harm
	•	Predicted uncertainty

Likely anatomical substrates

1️⃣ Cortex (model-level error)

Prefrontal cortex compares:
	•	Current state
	•	Simulated trajectory (hippocampal replay)
	•	Predicted future

Error here is representational:

“This trajectory doesn’t cohere.”

Functional magnetic resonance imaging and lesion studies support prefrontal involvement in prospective error evaluation.

Evidence strength: High
Epistemic confidence: High

⸻

2️⃣ Anterior cingulate cortex (conflict / effort error)

Anterior cingulate cortex

This region is strongly associated with:
	•	Conflict monitoring
	•	Effort cost computation
	•	Decision difficulty

Pre-commit error likely heavily routed through anterior cingulate cortex.

It signals:

“This choice has high cost or high conflict.”

Evidence strength: High
Epistemic confidence: High

⸻

3️⃣ Striatum (value gating error)

Striatum

Before commit, striatum integrates:
	•	Cortical proposals
	•	Dopaminergic prediction signals

Dopamine encodes reward prediction error in anticipatory form.

So pre-commit error is partly dopaminergic:

“Expected value deviates from baseline.”

Evidence strength: Very high (reinforcement learning literature)
Epistemic confidence: High

⸻

2️⃣ The Commit Moment

Commit occurs when:
	•	Basal ganglia output nuclei reduce thalamic inhibition.
	•	One cortical trajectory dominates.

This is threshold crossing.

⸻

3️⃣ Post-commit error: “What actually happened?”

This error arises after action execution.

It has two types:

⸻

A) Sensory reafference error

Motor system predicts consequences.
Actual sensory feedback arrives.
Mismatch computed.

Cerebellum plays major role here:

Cerebellum

Cerebellum:
	•	Predicts forward models.
	•	Detects motor prediction error.
	•	Rapidly updates motor commands.

Evidence strength: Very high
Epistemic confidence: High

⸻

B) Outcome value error

After outcome:

Dopamine neurons (substantia nigra / ventral tegmental area) encode:
	•	Reward prediction error.
	•	Better than expected.
	•	Worse than expected.

Substantia nigra

This updates striatal weights.

Evidence strength: Very high
Epistemic confidence: High

⸻

4️⃣ So where is the separation?

Here’s the clean division:

Pre-commit error

Location:
	•	Prefrontal cortex (model mismatch)
	•	Anterior cingulate cortex (conflict/effort)
	•	Striatum (anticipated value)

Function:
Simulated evaluation before gating.

⸻

Post-commit error

Location:
	•	Cerebellum (sensorimotor mismatch)
	•	Dopamine system (reward prediction error)
	•	Posterior cortex (state update)

Function:
Learning from executed reality.

⸻

5️⃣ In REE Terms

Let’s map this:
	•	E1: Deep world model (hippocampal traces + cortical structure)
	•	E2: Fast feedforward evaluation
	•	E3: Commitment selector

Then:

Pre-commit error = E1/E2 simulation mismatch before E3 threshold crossing
Post-commit error = reafference + reward prediction error after E3 release

The separation happens at the moment basal ganglia disinhibit thalamus.

Before:
Trajectory is hypothetical.

After:
Trajectory becomes causal intervention.

⸻

6️⃣ Where responsibility emerges

You earlier asserted:

Responsibility requires self-impact attribution.

That lives in post-commit space.

Because only after commitment do:
	•	Predicted reafference
	•	Observed reafference
	•	Outcome value
	•	Social consequence

Get attributed to the agent.

Basal ganglia gating is the boundary between:
	•	Hypothetical error
	•	Attributable error

That boundary is computationally real.

⸻

7️⃣ Important nuance

The separation is not anatomical alone.

It is temporal + circuit-based.

Pre-commit error:
Closed-loop simulation.

Post-commit error:
Open-loop world interaction.

That distinction matters more than exact structure.

⸻

8️⃣ Critical caveat

This is a functional systems-level model.
