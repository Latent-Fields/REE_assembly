1. Motivation

Psychiatric classification has historically been organised around:
	•	Phenomenology
	•	Course
	•	Treatment response
	•	Consensus clustering

These “stamp collections” preceded mechanistic understanding.

This document proposes a coordinate system for cognitive failure modes aligned with REE architectural components.

The aim is not to replace existing diagnoses, but to provide an orthogonal taxonomy organised by dynamical failure geometry rather than historical narrative.

This is a descriptive scaffold, not a final theory.

⸻

2. Principle

Failure modes of cognition may be more coherently described as positions in a multidimensional dynamical space defined by:
	•	Entropy regulation
	•	Precision allocation
	•	Residue accumulation
	•	Regime stability

Rather than by categorical syndromes.

This allows:
	•	Mechanism-oriented research
	•	Cross-diagnostic comparison
	•	Hypothesis generation for treatment selection
	•	Reduced moralisation of symptoms

3. Proposed Axes of Cognitive Failure

Axis 1 — Trajectory Entropy (Rollout Diversity)

Question:
How many viable futures can the system simulate and commit to?

Low:
	•	Behavioural narrowing
	•	Learned helplessness-like states
	•	Withdrawal
	•	Apparent “giving up”

High (pathological):
	•	Impulsivity
	•	Goal instability
	•	Erratic commitment

Architectural locus:
Hippocampal rollouts + E3 commitment.

⸻

Axis 2 — Representational Entropy (Latent Richness / Stability)

Question:
How coherent and stable is the generative model?

Low:
	•	Cognitive flattening
	•	Reduced abstraction
	•	Negative-symptom-like states
	•	Rigidity

High:
	•	Fragmentation
	•	Over-pattern detection
	•	Hallucination-like instability
	•	Delusional attractors

Architectural locus:
E1/E2 predictive substrate.

⸻

Axis 3 — Precision Allocation Stability (Control Plane)

Question:
Is confidence weighting calibrated?

Low precision:
	•	Indecision
	•	Poor learning
	•	Dithering

Excess precision:
	•	Overconfidence
	•	Rigid beliefs
	•	Catastrophic updating
	•	Misattribution of salience

Architectural locus:
Control plane / precision routing.

⸻

Axis 4 — Residue Load (Path Dependence Density)

Question:
How strongly does historical harm imprint constrain present trajectories?

Low:
	•	Poor learning from consequences
	•	Repetition of mistakes

High:
	•	Over-avoidance
	•	Trauma-patterned responses
	•	Defensive rigidity

Architectural locus:
Trajectory-level residue geometry (primary), possibly hybrid placement.

⸻

Axis 5 — Regime Stability (Mode Switching Dynamics)

Question:
How stable are control-plane regimes over time?

Stable:
	•	Adaptive flexibility

Unstable:
	•	Rapid oscillation (affective lability)
	•	Mode-lock (inability to exit one state)

Architectural locus:
Control plane dynamics across timescales.

⸻

4. Failure Vector Representation

Each presentation may be described as a vector:

FailureVector =
(TrajectoryEntropy, RepresentationalEntropy, PrecisionStability, ResidueLoad, RegimeStability)

This does not replace diagnosis.
It supplements it.

Two patients with the same DSM label may occupy very different regions of this space.

Two patients with different labels may cluster in similar regions.

⸻

5. Illustrative (Non-Definitive) Mappings

Trajectory Collapse Pattern
	•	Trajectory entropy ↓↓↓
	•	Residue load ↑
	•	Precision biased toward threat
	•	Representational entropy intact
	•	Regime stuck

Representational Instability Pattern
	•	Representational entropy ↑
	•	Precision misallocated
	•	Regime unstable
	•	Trajectory entropy variable

Representational Pruning Pattern
	•	Representational entropy ↓
	•	Trajectory entropy ↓
	•	Precision dampened
	•	Regime low volatility

Impulsive / Manic Pattern
	•	Trajectory entropy ↑↑
	•	Representational entropy ↑
	•	Precision dysregulated
	•	Regime unstable

These are heuristic examples only.

6. Why This May Improve Alignment With Pathology

This taxonomy:
	•	Organises around architecture rather than narrative.
	•	Makes symptom clusters secondary to dynamical state.
	•	Encourages mechanism-driven research.
	•	Allows treatment hypotheses based on axis imbalance rather than category.

For example:
	•	Low trajectory entropy → interventions increasing safe exploration.
	•	Precision dysregulation → gain stabilisation.
	•	Representational instability → entropy bounding and sensory grounding.
	•	Excess residue load → contextualisation and controlled re-exposure.

⸻

7. Clinical Value

This coordinate framing may:
	•	Reduce stigma (states, not identities).
	•	Restore hope (axes can move).
	•	Clarify formulation.
	•	Generate mechanism-grounded hypotheses.

It must remain provisional and patient-correctable.

⸻

8. Research Implications

The coordinate system allows questions such as:
	•	Do biomarkers cluster by vector region?
	•	Do imaging findings correlate with representational entropy rather than diagnosis?
	•	Do stress hormones track precision instability?
	•	Do treatment responses map to specific axis movement?

This shifts psychiatry toward physics-like explanation built atop structured taxonomy.

⸻

9. Constraints and Limitations

This system does not yet incorporate:
	•	Developmental timing
	•	Structural injury
	•	Substance effects
	•	Neurodegeneration
	•	Environmental volatility

These are modulators, not primary axes, but may require later integration.

This taxonomy is descriptive, not explanatory.

⸻

10. Governance Note

This document proposes a coordinate system for organising failure modes.

It does not:
	•	Modify architectural claims.
	•	Replace clinical diagnostic systems.
	•	Assert sufficiency for psychiatric explanation.

Promotion would require:
	•	Operational definitions for each axis.
	•	Simulation alignment in REE models.
	•	Empirical correlation studies.
	•	Conflict review with existing ARC/MECH documents.
