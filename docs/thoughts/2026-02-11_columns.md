Columnar Motif vs Columnar Geometry

Implications for REE Architectural Design

⸻

1. Core Distinction

Biological cortex exhibits:
	•	A canonical microcircuit motif
	•	A spatial columnar geometry

These are not the same phenomenon.

For REE, we must separate:

(A) Functional motif
(B) Anatomical bundling

The former is computationally relevant.
The latter may be biologically contingent.

⸻

2. What Is the Canonical Motif?

Across mammalian cortex we observe:
	•	Laminar separation (feedforward vs feedback bias)
	•	Local recurrent excitation
	•	Lateral inhibition
	•	Top–down modulatory input
	•	Distinct input and output layers
	•	Precision modulation (gain control)

Even in species without clear anatomical columns, this laminar microcircuit is conserved.

This suggests:

The functional motif is fundamental.
The cylindrical spatial clustering is optional.

⸻

3. Why Columns Exist in Biology (Probable Causes)

Columnar spatial bundling likely reflects:
	•	Wiring minimisation constraints
	•	Energy efficiency pressures
	•	Radial developmental migration
	•	Surface area expansion in large brains
	•	Vascular and metabolic embedding constraints

Evidence:
	•	Rodents show weaker columnar structure.
	•	Primates show stronger columnar clustering.
	•	Larger brains amplify long-distance wiring cost.

Thus:

Column geometry may be a metabolic and developmental optimisation rather than a computational primitive.

4. The Cerebellar Contrast

The cerebellum:
	•	Highly uniform microcircuit
	•	Massive parallel expansion
	•	Sparse coding
	•	Extremely fast forward modelling
	•	Minimal representational heterogeneity

The cortex:
	•	Heterogeneous
	•	Recurrent
	•	Integrative
	•	Slower abstraction
	•	Multi-modal binding

The cerebellum demonstrates that:

Rapid forward prediction does not require columnar geometry.

This weakens the hypothesis that columns exist to enable fast feedforward stacking.

⸻

5. What Might Be Computationally Valuable for REE?

The following properties are likely portable:
	•	Local recurrence before global integration
	•	Structured prediction vs error channels
	•	Modulatory precision control
	•	Sparse long-range routing
	•	Partial isolation to reduce representational entanglement
	•	Stable substructures that support error attribution

Columns may reduce destructive interference by clustering correlated features.

The computational abstraction becomes:

Architecturally enforced locality reduces entropic mixing and improves corrigibility.

This does not require cylindrical modules.

It requires:
	•	Functional locality
	•	Contained update regions
	•	Controlled cross-module coupling

⸻

6. Corrigibility Implication

If representational objects form within partially bounded microcircuits:
	•	Error attribution becomes more local.
	•	Intervention becomes more contained.
	•	Catastrophic global drift is reduced.

Thus:

Column-like modularity may support corrigibility
—but spatial columns are not required.

⸻

7. Design Principle for REE

Do not replicate anatomical columns.

Do implement:
	•	Modular recurrent microcircuits
	•	Limited lateral spillover
	•	Sparse routing constraints
	•	Clear attribution boundaries
	•	Precision-weighted integration
	•	Temporal depth via recurrence rather than excessive serial depth

The guiding abstraction:

REE should favour functional locality without enforcing biological geometry.

⸻

8. Open Questions for Future Investigation
	•	Does modular clustering reduce catastrophic interference in L-space?
	•	Does enforced locality improve self-impact attribution?
	•	What is the minimal boundary necessary for stable object formation?
	•	Can oscillatory or temporal partitioning substitute for spatial partitioning?

⸻

9. Working Hypothesis (for repo tracking)

H1: Columnar spatial organisation in cortex is largely a metabolic and developmental artefact.

H2: The canonical microcircuit motif is computationally fundamental.

H3: REE should adopt functional locality and recurrence without copying anatomical column geometry.
