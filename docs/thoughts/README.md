# Thought Intake (Unprocessed)

This folder is a holding area for raw thoughts, concerns, or new understandings about REE that have not yet been promoted into canonical docs.

## Rules

- Do not delete or overwrite existing notes.
- Each thought should be its own file.
- Use a stable filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD_short-title.md`.
- Each thought file should end with a short list of possible affected components (E1/E2/E3/L-space/control plane/etc.).

## Processing

When a thought is processed:
- Leave the original file intact.
- Add a short note at the top: `Status: processed` and a link to the canonical doc(s) and claim IDs it affected.
- Update the claim registry and changelog.

This folder is intentionally separate from canonical documentation.
