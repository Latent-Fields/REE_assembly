A Papez-like loop can be treated as a **provenance gate**: E1-generated content should not be committed at high
precision unless a hippocampal trace and temporal ordering support it. When this gate fails, confabulation-like
behavior appears: internally generated narratives presented as grounded reality.

## Possible affected components

- Hippocampal systems (ARC-007, ARC-018)
- Control-plane gating (ARC-005)
- Commitment licensing (ARC-003)
