# Formal Alignment Glossary: JEPA to REE

Status: processed

## Thought

Create a formal terminology bridge between JEPA-style latent predictive world-model language and REE architecture
language so architecture discussions can be interoperable without collapsing the frameworks into one.

Core intent:

- align representation and prediction terms (`embedding`, `encoder`, `latent predictor`) with REE terms (`L-space`,
  `E1`, `E2`);
- explicitly map agentic extension gaps (action-conditioning, self-modeling, control-plane arbitration) to REE
  commitments (reafference loops, E3 gating, control plane);
- preserve divergence points (objective-centric vs constraint-centric) instead of hiding them;
- define a minimal interoperability principle where JEPA-like world models can serve as REE representational substrate
  while REE contributes control and viability constraints.

## Architectural Implications

- Add a formal alignment glossary section in canonical terminology docs.
- Keep mapping directional and falsifiable (alignment aid, not equivalence proof).
- Use harmonized terms in future dispatch briefs and conflict notes when comparing REE to adjacent model families.
