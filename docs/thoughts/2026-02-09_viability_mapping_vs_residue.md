Viability mapping updates the **navigability** of paths after commitment (based on predicted vs observed
`SELF_SENSORY` and resulting WORLD/HOMEOSTASIS/HARM shifts). Residue updates the **ethical curvature** \(\phi(z)\)
based on harm/violation outcomes. Both are post-action, but they encode different information.

## Possible affected components

- Residue geometry updates (ARC-013)
- Hippocampal viability mapping (ARC-018)
