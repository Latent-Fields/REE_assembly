This study demonstrates that hippocampal neurons initially fire at reward delivery but, with learning, shift their activity backward in time toward earlier predictive cues in a reward-based task.

Standard Interpretation

The authors frame this as predictive coding of reward:
	•	Early learning → reward representation at outcome.
	•	With learning → representation shifts to earlier predictive states.
	•	Interpretation → hippocampus encodes anticipatory reward signals.

This is consistent with temporal-difference reinforcement learning.

Alternative Interpretation: Commitment-Gate Migration

We propose a structurally distinct reading:

The backward shift does not merely represent prediction.

It represents migration of the commitment evaluation boundary.

Core Claim

As learning stabilises, the system relocates the internal responsibility checkpoint from reward receipt to the earliest point at which the trajectory becomes causally constrained.

In other words:

The hippocampus tracks the moving boundary of commitment.

Mechanistic Framing

Phase 1 — Early Learning
	•	Commitment is uncertain and unstable.
	•	Outcome (reward/no reward) provides primary error signal.
	•	Hippocampal activity anchors at reward delivery.
	•	Responsibility attribution is outcome-based.

System structure:

Action → Outcome → Error update

Phase 2 — Policy Consolidation
	•	The decision policy stabilises.
	•	The system identifies earlier states that reliably determine outcome.
	•	Error attribution migrates upstream.
	•	Hippocampal activity shifts to the earliest determinative node.

System structure:

Commitment point → Trajectory bias → Outcome

The hippocampus encodes:

“This is where the future became constrained.”

⸻

Distinction from Predictive Coding

Predictive coding view:
	•	Reward representation propagates backward through predictive states.

Commitment-gate view:
	•	Responsibility attribution propagates backward to the earliest point of causal ownership.

This is not a trivial semantic shift.

Prediction can exist without agency.

Commitment requires agency or at least trajectory selection.

⸻

Relevance to REE Architecture

In Reflective–Ethical Engine (REE) terms:
	•	E1: Deep trajectory model
	•	E2: Fast predictor / short-horizon estimator
	•	E3: Trajectory selector (commitment layer)

Early system:
	•	Responsibility evaluated at outcome node.
	•	Weak self-impact attribution.

Mature system:
	•	Responsibility evaluated at selection node.
	•	Strong self-impact attribution.
	•	Ethical learning becomes structurally internalised.

Thus:

Backward shift = increasing temporal resolution of responsibility.

This aligns with the requirement that viable agents must migrate evaluation toward the site of intervention.

⸻

Stronger Hypothesis

The hippocampus may encode:

The earliest point at which trajectory entropy collapses below a threshold.

This reframes the shift as:
	•	Not reward anticipation.
	•	Not value coding.
	•	But detection of “point-of-no-return” in state space.

This is deeply relevant for ethical architectures because:

Responsibility is not about outcome.
It is about where intervention altered trajectory.

⸻

Empirical Discriminator

To distinguish interpretations:

Prediction Hypothesis

Backward shift occurs even in purely Pavlovian paradigms without active commitment.

Commitment Migration Hypothesis

Backward shift depends on:
	•	Action selection.
	•	Policy stabilisation.
	•	Trajectory constraint via agency.

Critical experiment:
Remove choice while preserving predictive cues.

If backward migration persists unchanged → prediction model sufficient.
If migration weakens or disappears → commitment-boundary model gains support.

⸻

Broader Implication

If validated, this phenomenon suggests:

Biological systems do not simply learn to predict reward.

They learn to internalise responsibility earlier in time.

This provides a neural signature for:
	•	Increasing agency resolution.
	•	Increasing causal self-attribution.
	•	Ethical maturation as structural time-shift.

In REE terms:

Ethical intelligence may require backward migration of commitment evaluation nodes.

⸻

Open Questions
	1.	Does the shift correlate with motor cortex consolidation?
	2.	Does dopamine prediction error diminish as hippocampal activity migrates?
	3.	Is this phenomenon present in non-choice paradigms?
	4.	Does hippocampal backward migration correlate with decreased behavioural variability?

⸻

Minimal Summary

The hippocampal backward temporal shift described in Yaghoubi et al. (2026) may represent not merely reward prediction, but migration of the internal commitment boundary. As learning stabilises, responsibility attribution moves upstream toward the earliest determinative node. This provides a possible neural substrate for increasing agency resolution and may be a structural requirement for ethical architectures such as REE.
