Thought: The Control Plane, Pre-Commitment, and the Amygdala Analogue

0. Premise

Mammalian cognition is not continuously deliberative.
It is regime-based.

At any moment the organism is in a mode:
	•	Explore
	•	Exploit
	•	Defend
	•	Freeze
	•	Bond
	•	Play
	•	Vigilant readiness
	•	Restorative
	•	Etc.

These modes:
	•	Change precision weighting
	•	Change policy search space
	•	Change time horizon
	•	Change learning rate
	•	Change valuation bias
	•	Change autonomic tone

The brain does not compute these from scratch every time.

There must be:

A fast control-plane state selector
+
A slower deliberative trajectory evaluator.

1. Architectural Components

A. Pre-Commitment Mode Manager (PCM)

This was already hypothesised in REE.

Function:
	•	Determines which behavioural regime is active
	•	Constrains E3 trajectory search before deep evaluation
	•	Defines what kinds of policies are even permissible

This is a structural gate.

⸻

B. Amygdala Analogue (AA)

Proposed function:

A fast salience classifier that:
	•	Operates before full trajectory search
	•	Updates global behavioural mode priors
	•	Influences precision modulation
	•	Interacts with valence gain overlays (μ/κ analogues)
	•	Modulates learning rate and horizon length

It does not compute trajectories.

It updates the priors over which regimes are appropriate.

⸻

2. Control Plane States

Let’s define control-plane states explicitly.

These are not emotions.
They are global computational configurations.

1. Exploratory Mode
	•	Low threat precision
	•	High novelty tolerance
	•	Longer time horizon
	•	Increased learning rate
	•	Dopaminergic salience tuned to uncertainty

2. Defensive Mode
	•	High threat precision
	•	Narrowed policy space
	•	Short time horizon
	•	Increased sensory gain
	•	Reduced exploratory branching

3. Bonding / Social Mode
	•	Increased social signal weighting
	•	μ-opioid analogue gain increase
	•	Reduced defensive bias
	•	Enhanced memory tagging for social cues

4. Exploitative / Goal-Directed Mode
	•	High precision on selected policy
	•	Reduced branching
	•	Dopaminergic drive increased
	•	Horizon moderately short

5. Restorative Mode
	•	Reduced global precision
	•	Reduced active policy search
	•	Memory consolidation bias
	•	Energy budget restoration

These modes are computational states.

⸻

3. Amygdala Analogue as Mode Prior Updater

The AA receives:
	•	Compressed latent representations (from E1/E2 fusion space)
	•	Interoceptive state signals
	•	Social model signals
	•	Harm prediction streams
	•	Energy status
	•	Uncertainty measures

It computes:

A fast salience-weighted classification of:

“What kind of situation is this?”

This outputs:

A distribution over control-plane modes.

Not a decision — a prior.

The PCM then:

Commits or maintains current mode based on:
	•	AA input
	•	Historical stability
	•	Cost of switching
	•	Trajectory evaluation feedback

So AA suggests.
PCM commits.

⸻

4. Interaction with Precision Modulation

Mode state influences:
	•	Global precision weighting
	•	Dopaminergic gain fields
	•	Serotonergic horizon tolerance
	•	Learning rate scaling

For example:

Defensive Mode →
	•	Increase threat precision
	•	Reduce exploratory branching
	•	Increase sensory gain

Exploratory Mode →
	•	Increase uncertainty tolerance
	•	Broaden trajectory search
	•	Increase novelty reward weighting

Thus:

AA indirectly shapes all subsequent inference.

⸻

5. Interaction with Valence Gain Overlays

Introduce two distributed overlays:

μ-analogue → positive hedonic amplification
κ-analogue → dysphoric bias amplification

These overlays:
	•	Modulate valuation nodes
	•	Influence policy attractiveness
	•	Influence bonding weight
	•	Bias attention

AA influences these overlays.

Example:

Social safety detected →
AA biases toward Bonding Mode →
μ-analogue gain increased →
Positive salience amplification →
Exploratory-social behaviours expand.

Chronic stress →
AA biases toward Defensive Mode →
κ-analogue gain increased →
Positive salience suppressed →
Policy space narrows.

6. Learning Rate and Horizon Length

Amygdala projections in biology influence:
	•	Hippocampal memory encoding
	•	Prefrontal control
	•	Dopaminergic firing

In REE analogue:

Mode affects:
	•	Learning rate (η)
	•	Temporal horizon (T)
	•	Model update thresholds
	•	Credit assignment depth

Defensive Mode:
	•	Short horizon
	•	Fast reinforcement update
	•	Memory tagging strong for threat cues

Exploratory Mode:
	•	Longer horizon
	•	Slower learning rate
	•	Broader associative linking

Bonding Mode:
	•	Social cue tagging amplified
	•	Long-term relational memory strengthened

Thus AA indirectly governs meta-learning.

⸻

7. Pre-Commitment and Commitment Stability

Mode switching is costly.

Therefore:

PCM includes hysteresis.

Mode does not flip instantly on small salience changes.

Switch requires:
	•	Sustained salience signal
	•	Confidence threshold
	•	Energy budget compatibility

This prevents oscillatory instability.

The amygdala analogue supplies rapid suggestions.
PCM ensures stability.

⸻

8. Why This Fits Biology

Biological amygdala:
	•	Rapidly encodes emotional salience
	•	Biases attention
	•	Biases dopamine release
	•	Influences autonomic tone
	•	Modulates memory consolidation
	•	Alters prefrontal engagement

It does not compute detailed plans.

It alters how plans are computed.

This matches:

AA as fast mode prior updater
PCM as regime commitment system
E3 as trajectory evaluator

⸻

9. What This Solves in REE

Without AA:

REE is continuously deliberative.

With AA:

REE becomes regime-shifting.

This allows:
	•	Joy states (low threat + μ gain + exploratory mode)
	•	Dysphoric states (κ gain + defensive mode)
	•	Mania-like states (dopamine gain + exploratory mode without threat gating)
	•	Trauma-like states (persistent defensive mode bias)

It introduces:

State-dependent cognition.

⸻

10. Summary of the Thought

The amygdala analogue in REE should be:

A fast salience classifier embedded in the control plane.

It:
	•	Updates behavioural mode priors
	•	Biases precision weighting
	•	Interacts with valence overlays
	•	Alters learning rate and horizon
	•	Suggests regime shifts
	•	Operates pre-deliberatively

The Pre-Commitment Mode Manager:
	•	Commits to regime
	•	Maintains stability
	•	Prevents oscillation
	•	Interfaces with E3

Together they form:

The dynamic control-plane architecture.

outstanding:
	•	Formalise this as Amygdala.md
	•	Define a minimal mathematical schema for mode priors
