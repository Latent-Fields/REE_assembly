# Social Projection via Self-Like Inference

Status: processed

## Thought

When world objects become sufficiently persistent and behaviorally complex, REE should treat them as candidates for
hidden-state explanatory models that reuse self-model machinery with caveats rather than building unrelated models.

This supports derived `OTHER_SELFLIKE` inference, projected viability streams, and downstream coupling into control and
trajectory processes.

## Architectural Implications

- Social projection is a transform from WORLD features to social-inference state, not a primitive sensory stream.
- Social inference should continue into precommit control pathways (other-harm and coupling influence), not terminate at
  detection.
- Care-override boundary conditions remain ethically open and should stay linked to Q-009.
