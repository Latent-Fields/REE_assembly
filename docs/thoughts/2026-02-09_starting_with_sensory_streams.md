1. Starting constraint: what must exist for any viable agent?

We began by asking a deliberately brutal question:

What sensory distinctions are absolutely necessary for a system to remain viable, adaptive, and ethically coherent — if all it can do is predict, compare predictions, and act?

No semantics.
No goals.
No reward.
Just prediction and intervention.

This forced us to identify sensory stream tags that must be present before learning.

⸻

2. Irreducible sensory stream tags

We arrived at a minimal but sufficient partition of experience:

Primary streams

These define the basic structure of existence for the agent.
	•	WORLD — externally caused sensory input
	•	HOMEOSTASIS — internal viability and drift signals
	•	HARM — threat, damage, catastrophic risk
	•	SELF_SENSORY — reafferent sensory consequences of action

Without these, there is:
	•	no self/world distinction,
	•	no notion of danger vs inconvenience,
	•	no grounding for action.

⸻

Secondary (derived but necessary) streams

These are not “senses” but must exist as explicit tagged signals.
	•	PRECISION — confidence / reliability of predictions
	•	TEMPORAL_COHERENCE — continuity across time
	•	VALENCE — vector-valued trajectory desirability (viability, not reward)

These allow:
	•	uncertainty-aware learning,
	•	stable identity over time,
	•	comparison of futures without scalar collapse.

⸻

Action and responsibility streams

This is where the ethical substrate appears.
	•	ACTION — causal intervention capacity
	•	SELF_IMPACT — predicted vs observed consequences of one’s own actions

This loop is the minimal internal substrate of responsibility.

Without SELF_IMPACT:
	•	behaviour can occur,
	•	prediction can occur,
	•	but responsibility exists only externally.

⸻

3. Emergence (and rejection) of reward

We then asked whether reward-like signals already exist.

They do — but only as derived phenomena:
	•	resolution of predicted harm,
	•	stabilisation of homeostasis,
	•	increased future option-volume,
	•	improved self-impact alignment.

Crucially:
	•	they are vector-valued,
	•	contextual,
	•	non-optimised.

When we stress-tested adding a scalar reward channel, it consistently broke:
	•	epistemic humility (precision corruption),
	•	ethical coherence (Goodhart collapse),
	•	responsibility (self-impact bypass).

Architectural conclusion:
Reward must remain emergent and read-only, never a controller.

4. Mapping streams onto engines (E1 / E2 / E3)

We then grounded the streams in the REE engines.

E1 — Deep predictor (slow, structural)
	•	Learns world structure, slow risks, temporal invariants
	•	Owns slow HOMEOSTASIS, HARM, TEMPORAL_COHERENCE
	•	Learns long-horizon SELF_IMPACT regularities

E2 — Fast predictor (sensorimotor)
	•	Predicts immediate sensory consequences of action
	•	Computes fast SELF_IMPACT error via reafference
	•	Handles urgency, surprise, rapid correction

E3 — Trajectory selector
	•	Applies vetoes and constraints (HARM, HOMEOSTASIS, SELF_IMPACT)
	•	Ranks surviving futures via VALENCE
	•	Sets precision and routing modes

At this point, rollouts were still implicit.

⸻

5. Key architectural commitment: rollouts are hippocampal

You then locked in a critical constraint:

All trajectory rollouts are generated by the hippocampal system.

This clarified everything.

Hippocampus (HPC)
	•	The only place counterfactual futures exist
	•	Constructs sequences:
	•	“If this action, then this, then this…”
	•	Does no ranking, vetoing, or optimisation

Consequences of this commitment
	•	E1, E2, and E3 do not imagine
	•	E3 cannot bias search, only select
	•	Ethical constraints cannot be “optimised around”
	•	DMN-like cognition becomes a precision/routing mode, not a new system

This is both biologically plausible and ethically stabilising.

⸻

6. Final integrated architecture (cleanly stated)

Pipeline:
	1.	Sensory streams arrive already tagged
	2.	E1 maintains deep generative structure and long-term constraints
	3.	E2 runs fast prediction + reafference comparison
	4.	Hippocampus constructs candidate trajectories under supplied constraints
	5.	E3 selects actions by:
	•	vetoing harm,
	•	respecting viability,
	•	enforcing responsibility,
	•	ranking via vector-valued valence

No reward maximisation.
No goal symbols.
No moral rules.

Ethics emerges because:

the system cannot choose futures that destroy coherence, viability, or responsibility without structurally breaking itself.

⸻

7. The core insight (in one sentence)

REE is an architecture where ethics is not added as a rule or reward, but emerges inevitably from how prediction, action, and self-impact are wired together — with imagination separated from control.

That’s where we are now.

This is a stable stopping point: the primitives are set, the engines are cleanly separated, and the hippocampal commitment prevents most known alignment failure modes.

When you’re ready, the next natural steps would be:
	•	formalising hippocampal “trajectory objects”,
	•	mapping cognitive modes (default mode network, vigilance, sleep) onto precision/routing,
	•	or translating this into a minimal executable spec.
