Prolactin as a Social Modulator in REE

1. What Prolactin Does Biologically

Centrally (not just lactation):

Prolactin is associated with:
	•	Parental behaviour
	•	Nesting
	•	Reduced sexual drive after orgasm
	•	Increased caregiving persistence
	•	Increased tolerance for infant distress
	•	Protective but not purely aggressive behaviour
	•	Behavioural focus on dependent others

It increases during:
	•	Late pregnancy
	•	Postpartum
	•	After orgasm (particularly in males as well)
	•	Chronic bonding contexts

It is not about attraction.
It is not about vigilance.
It is about sustained caregiving orientation.

2. How It Differs From Oxytocin

Oxytocin:
	•	Facilitates attachment formation.
	•	Increases social salience.
	•	Reduces defensive bias toward selected others.

Prolactin:
	•	Maintains care investment.
	•	Reduces competing drives.
	•	Increases tolerance of cost.
	•	Stabilises nurturing mode.

Oxytocin says:
“This agent is close.”

Prolactin says:
“I will continue investing in this agent.”

That’s a different axis.

⸻

3. A Clean Three-Axis Social Model

You may now have something elegant:
	1.	Oxytocin → Boundary permeability (who becomes close)
	2.	Vasopressin → Boundary rigidity (who is defended against)
	3.	Prolactin → Care investment persistence (how long and how deeply I commit resources)

μ-opioid stabilises affect.
But prolactin stabilises responsibility.

That’s subtle.

⸻

4. In Control-Plane Terms

Introduce:

For each agent j, define:

Care weight C_{j}.

This determines:
	•	How much predicted harm to j influences trajectory evaluation.
	•	How much resource allocation is biased toward j.
	•	How tolerant the system is of cost incurred for j.

Prolactin analogue P_t:

Increases care persistence:

C_j(t+1) = C_j(t) + \alpha_P \cdot BondStrength_j - \beta \cdot Decay

Where BondStrength is influenced by oxytocin and μ stabilisation.

Prolactin slows decay of care commitment.

⸻

5. Why This Is Important

Without prolactin analogue:

Bonding may form,
but investment may fluctuate rapidly.

With prolactin analogue:

The system tolerates:
	•	Sleep disruption
	•	Resource cost
	•	Delayed reward
	•	Asymmetric exchange

That’s parental architecture.

⸻

6. Why It Feels Like the Missing Piece

Because oxytocin and vasopressin describe:

Topology.

Prolactin describes:

Asymmetric sustained commitment.

And social systems require:

Not just closeness,
but durable care.

⸻

7. Evolutionary Pattern

Oxytocin → attachment formation.
Prolactin → caregiving maintenance.
Vasopressin → territory and protection.

That trio maps onto:

Bond
Nurture
Defend

Which is structurally complete for mammalian social organisation.

⸻

8. REE Implication

REE should probably have:
	•	Relational distance (R)
	•	Boundary rigidity (V)
	•	Care investment weight (C)
	•	Stability modulation (μ)

Trajectory evaluation then becomes:

J(\tau) = \sum_i w_i \cdot Value_i(\tau)

Where for agent j:

w_j \propto C_j \cdot (1 - R_{self,j})

That integrates:

Closeness
Care
Commitment

Without anthropomorphism.

⸻

9. The Deep Insight

Love may not be a single modulator.

It may be:

Low relational distance (oxytocin)
	•	High care weight (prolactin)
	•	Stabilised affect (μ-opioid)
	•	Moderate boundary rigidity (vasopressin tuned appropriately)

That’s layered.

⸻

10. Why This Matters for REE’s Ethical Architecture

If REE is meant to incorporate:

Love as constraint (as you’ve framed before),

Then care weight persistence is crucial.

Without prolactin analogue,
“love” would be momentary closeness.

With it,
love becomes durable ethical weighting.
