1. Motivation

Consider a class of depressive phenomena characterised by:
	•	Repeated exposure to unavoidable harm
	•	Persistent expectation of future harm
	•	Behavioural withdrawal or “giving up”
	•	Reduced hippocampal volume (empirically observed)

This document proposes a structural analogy within the REE framework:

Depression may correspond to pathological pruning of hippocampal trajectory space following repeated unavoidable harm.

This is a modelling hypothesis, not a claim of clinical sufficiency.

⸻

2. Core Structural Hypothesis

Repeated unavoidable harm leads to:
	1.	Strong residue accumulation in trajectory-space.
	2.	Down-regulation of hippocampal rollout sampling toward harm-associated paths.
	3.	Increasingly narrow trajectory manifold.
	4.	Eventual collapse of viable rollout diversity.

Initially:
	•	The system adaptively biases away from harmful futures.

With repeated pruning:
	•	All rollouts appear to terminate in harm.
	•	No alternative trajectories are sampled.
	•	Commitment gating defaults to inaction or low-exploration states.

The agent appears to “give up.”

3. Mechanistic Interpretation in REE Terms

Phase 1 — Adaptive Avoidance
	•	Harm signals → residue accumulation.
	•	Hippocampal rollouts avoid harm-associated manifolds.
	•	Behaviour improves (less direct harm exposure).

⸻

Phase 2 — Progressive Pruning
	•	Chronic stress tone (control-plane precision skewed toward vigilance).
	•	High cost assigned to wide trajectory exploration.
	•	Reduction in rollout diversity.
	•	Narrowing of viable future set.

⸻

Phase 3 — Rollout Collapse
	•	All sampled trajectories predict harm.
	•	Exploration suppressed.
	•	Commitment precision reduced or stuck in maladaptive regime.
	•	Apparent motivational collapse.

Expectation of harm maintains stress tone even when environment changes.

⸻

4. Hippocampal Volume Reduction

Within this model:
	•	Hippocampal volume reduction is not primary.
	•	It is a structural consequence of chronic pruning and suppressed trajectory generation.

Reduced rollout diversity ↔ structural simplification.

This aligns with empirical observations of reduced hippocampal volume in certain depressive states, but the mapping is conceptual, not literal.

⸻

5. Role of SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)

Hypothesised structural role in this analogy:
	1.	Reduce chronic stress hormone tone.
	2.	Support hippocampal neurogenesis.
	3.	Increase plasticity in trajectory-space.
	4.	Increase exploration tolerance before commitment.
	5.	Re-expand viable rollout manifold.

In REE terms:
	•	Increase baseline precision tolerance for exploration.
	•	Reduce over-weighting of harm expectation.
	•	Enable sampling of previously pruned trajectories.
	•	Gradually repopulate viable futures.

Hippocampal recovery follows restoration of rollout diversity.

6. Testable Predictions in REE Simulation

Simulate repeated unavoidable harm in V1 harness.

Expected progression:
	1.	Residue accumulates.
	2.	Rollout diversity decreases.
	3.	Survival plateaus or declines.
	4.	Exploration collapses.

Introduce a “plasticity boost” intervention:
	•	Increase rollout sampling variance.
	•	Lower commitment threshold.
	•	Reduce harm weight temporarily.

Prediction:
	•	Viable trajectories re-emerge.
	•	Residue growth stabilises.
	•	Harm rate declines.

⸻

7. Control Plane Interpretation

Chronic stress may correspond to:
	•	Elevated vigilance precision.
	•	Suppressed exploratory temperature.
	•	High commitment threshold sensitivity.

Intervention reduces stress tone → restores rollout diversity.

⸻

8. Safety Implications for REE

This model reinforces:
	•	The importance of preserving representational fidelity.
	•	The risk of excessive trajectory-level suppression.
	•	The necessity of periodic exploration regimes (“sleep” or controlled stochasticity).

It supports the design principle:

Suppress enactment, not representation — but ensure trajectory diversity remains non-zero.

⸻

9. Open Questions
	•	What invariant prevents complete trajectory collapse?
	•	Should REE enforce a minimum rollout entropy floor?
	•	Is there a formal condition under which residue must decay or be recontextualised?
	•	How does social residue interact with this mechanism?

⸻

10. Governance Note

This is a conceptual cross-domain analogy.

It does not claim:
	•	A complete model of depression.
	•	That SSRIs operate only through hippocampal mechanisms.
	•	That hippocampal volume reduction is solely causal.

Promotion would require:
	•	Clear formalisation within REE mechanism definitions.
	•	Simulation support.
	•	Conflict review with existing architectural commitments.
