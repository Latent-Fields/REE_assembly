The arcuate fasciculus suggests a **dorsal sequence-to-motor channel** and a **distributed dorsal+ventral** language
network rather than a single tract. In REE terms, this implies fast routing from hippocampal rollouts to motor
affordances plus a low-latency correction loop, while keeping language as a compression/coordination layer.

## Possible affected components

- Language emergence nudges (ARC-009, MECH-010)
- E2 articulation affordances (ARC-002)
- Hippocampal rollout interface (ARC-018)
