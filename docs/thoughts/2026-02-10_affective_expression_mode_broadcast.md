Affective expression may act as a **pre‑verbal display** of cognitive mode or control‑plane regime. Rather than
encoding content, these displays expose coarse parameters (arousal, readiness, veto sensitivity, valence bias),
allowing social partners to reduce predictive load and coordinate without language.

The proximity of cranial‑nerve afferent/efferent loops to brainstem control systems suggests a plausible low‑latency
channel for embodied signaling, but this is treated as a functional hypothesis rather than an anatomical claim.

Possible affected components:
- Social cognition and mirror modelling (ARC-010)
- Control‑plane regime signaling (ARC-005, ARC-016)
- Mode‑space interpretation in social coordination (MECH-039)
