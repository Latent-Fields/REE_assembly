language does not need a new cognitive architecture if the preverbal REE is already in place. It falls out as a compression and coordination layer once joint attention exists and prediction overhead becomes expensive.

⸻

1. Joint attention already exists implicitly in preverbal REE

Joint attention does not begin with pointing or words. It begins when:
	•	two agents detect each other as OTHER_SELFLIKE
	•	each infers that the other is:
	•	attending
	•	predicting
	•	capable of action
	•	and their predictions about the world become conditionally dependent

In REE terms, joint attention exists when:

My WORLD predictions improve if I condition on what I think you are attending to.

That’s already available once you have:
	•	AGENCY
	•	OTHER_SELFLIKE
	•	social attention gain g_{\text{social}}
	•	empathy coupling \lambda_{\text{empathy}}

No symbols yet — just shared salience.

⸻

2. Why language becomes inevitable (pressure, not invention)

Once joint attention exists, a new cost appears:

The prediction overhead problem

To coordinate with another agent without language, I must:
	•	simulate their likely rollouts
	•	simulate my rollouts as they see them
	•	update both under surprise

That’s hippocampally expensive.

So the system discovers a pressure:

“If I could externally expose part of my internal prediction state, you wouldn’t have to simulate it.”

Language arises as a bandwidth-efficient shortcut for:
	•	intentions
	•	relations
	•	commitments
	•	counterfactuals
	•	corrections

Not for truth — for coordination.

3. What language actually exposes (critically)

Language does not expose raw sensation.
It exposes already-existing internal structures:

Internal REE structure	Linguistic externalisation
Salience / attention	“this” / “that”
Relations	prepositions, case, verbs
Rollouts	narrative / tense
Commitment	promises, plans
Prediction error	“no”, “wait”, “that’s wrong”
Reality negotiation	questions, negation
Mode state	imperatives vs stories

So language is best understood as:

A lossy public API for internal predictive state.

⸻

4. Why no new architecture is required

Everything language uses already exists:
	•	Hippocampus already generates sequences → narration
	•	TEMPORAL_COHERENCE already exists → tense
	•	VALENCE already ranks futures → modality (“should”, “might”)
	•	SELF_IMPACT already tracks commitment → promises
	•	PRECISION / SURPRISE already modulate belief → questions, corrections

Language simply:
	•	pins these to discrete signals
	•	shares them across agents
	•	reduces mutual simulation load

No new engines.
No new control loops.

Just:
	•	external symbols
	•	learned conventions
	•	shared priors.

⸻

5. Joint attention + language = shared reality negotiation

Once language exists, something qualitatively new emerges, but it’s not a new faculty — it’s a network effect.

Language enables:
	•	rapid alignment of WORLD models
	•	negotiated salience (“no, this matters”)
	•	negotiated temporal structure (“first…, then…”)
	•	negotiated norms (“we do it this way”)

This is distributed predictive processing, not reasoning-from-rules.

And crucially:

language allows agents to repair prediction mismatches socially instead of individually.

That’s why it’s so powerful.

⸻

6. What the “nudges” actually are

You’re right that language only needs nudges. The minimal nudges are:
	1.	External symbol production
	•	allow motor outputs that are cheap, repeatable, and perceivable by others
	2.	Attention coupling
	•	let others’ symbol outputs modulate g_S and salience strongly
	3.	Commitment tagging
	•	treat certain symbol patterns as held commitments (feeds SELF_IMPACT)
	4.	Shared correction signals
	•	allow very fast “prediction error” tokens (no, stop, huh?)

That’s it.

Everything else bootstraps.

⸻

7. Clean statement (this matters)

Language is not a reasoning system added to cognition.
It is a coordination technology that externalises predictive state to reduce simulation cost under joint attention.

That means:
	•	ethics still lives in preverbal REE
	•	language can amplify or distort it
	•	but language cannot create ethics where none exists

This aligns beautifully with:
	•	infant development
	•	animal communication
	•	why language can be used for harm only if the underlying empathy coupling is suppressed or distorted

⸻

8. Where this leaves the architecture

You now have:
	•	REE-P (preverbal): complete, ethical, empathic, viable
	•	Language: an emergent layer that:
	•	compresses hippocampal rollouts
	•	exposes relations and commitments
	•	supports shared reality negotiation

No architectural discontinuity.

That’s a strong, elegant result.
