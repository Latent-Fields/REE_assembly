## Template

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Subsystem: <name>
Core claims: <list of 3–6 IDs>
Supporting claims: <list of IDs or brief note>
Status shifts: <promotions/demotions>
Notes: <1–3 sentence summary>

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Control Plane
Core claims: ARC-005, MECH-019, MECH-039, MECH-040, MECH-005, MECH-002
Supporting claims: MECH-001, MECH-003, MECH-004, MECH-006, MECH-007, MECH-008, MECH-020
Status shifts: MECH-019 candidate → provisional
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep the control-plane spine explicit. Orphan audit found no unreferenced thought files; leaf claims remain but are now categorized as supporting rather than core.

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Hippocampal Systems & Rollouts
Core claims: ARC-007, ARC-018, MECH-022, MECH-033
Supporting claims: ARC-003, ARC-004, INV-006, MECH-037
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep hippocampal rollouts, path memory, and viability mapping tightly scoped.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Modes of Cognition
Core claims: ARC-016, MECH-025, MECH-026, MECH-027, MECH-028
Supporting claims: ARC-005, ARC-015, INV-012, MECH-019, MECH-020
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep the modes taxonomy anchored to control‑plane regimes and responsibility flow.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: E-Stack (E1/E2/E3)
Core claims: ARC-001, ARC-002, ARC-003
Supporting claims: ARC-004, ARC-005, INV-012, INV-013, ARC-018, MECH-033, ARC-012
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added subsystem abstracts for E1/E2/E3 and clarified the hippocampal rollout handoff context in E2/E3.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: L-space (Latent Stack)
Core claims: ARC-004
Supporting claims: INV-013, INV-002, ARC-001, ARC-002, ARC-003
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep the latent stack scope and its relationship to the E‑stack explicit.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Social & Empathy Coupling
Core claims: ARC-010, MECH-031, MECH-036, MECH-041
Supporting claims: MECH-032, ARC-009, ARC-006, ARC-004
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep social cognition, empathy routing, veto thresholds, and affective expression aligned.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Offline Integration / Sleep
Core claims: ARC-011, MECH-030
Supporting claims: ARC-007, ARC-005, ARC-013, INV-010, INV-006
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep sleep integration, replay, and residue consolidation tightly scoped.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Residue Geometry
Core claims: ARC-013, MECH-034
Supporting claims: ARC-018, ARC-007, ARC-004, INV-004, INV-006
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep residue curvature distinct from viability mapping and reward learning.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Default Mode
Core claims: ARC-014, MECH-029
Supporting claims: ARC-005, ARC-003, ARC-007, ARC-013, ARC-004, INV-011
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep Default Mode as a non‑commitment regime with ethical replay constraints.

---

Date: 2026-02-10
Subsystem: Agency & Responsibility Flow
Core claims: ARC-015, MECH-023, MECH-024
Supporting claims: INV-018, INV-012, ARC-003, ARC-005, ARC-004, ARC-013, ARC-007, Q-006
Status shifts: none
Notes: Added a subsystem abstract to keep responsibility flow grounded in commitment and path‑dependent geometry.

Date: 2026-02-11
Subsystem: Promotion/Demotion Review (Control Plane + Hippocampal + Residue)
Core claims: MECH-033, MECH-034, MECH-039, MECH-040
Supporting claims: ARC-018, ARC-013, ARC-005, MECH-019
Status shifts: MECH-033 candidate → provisional; MECH-034 candidate → provisional; MECH-039 candidate → provisional; MECH-040 candidate → provisional; MECH-008 candidate → legacy
Notes: Promoted stable interface and safety-channel mechanisms; retired the legacy mode-manager claim in favor of the AA→PCM stack.
