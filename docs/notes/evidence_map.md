# REE Evidence Map (Neuroscience Anchors)

Lightweight mapping from REE architecture prompts to empirical anchors. These are not direct anatomical claims; they are
biological evidence points that inform constraints and plausibility.

## Control‑plane evidence summary

Across brainstem and basal‑ganglia studies, a consistent pattern emerges: state regulation is **multi‑channel** and
distributed, with fast interrupt pathways and distinct arousal/readiness controls. LC‑NE tonic vs phasic dynamics support
separating baseline arousal from volatility sensitivity, while DRN 5‑HT and ARAS findings imply arousal gating is not
reducible to local safety/precision. PPN/PPT cell‑type diversity reinforces a split between readiness/motor gating and
global arousal. Basal‑ganglia data show co‑activation of direct/indirect pathways and a hyperdirect stop route, supporting
E3 selection as competing pathway dynamics plus a privileged veto channel. PAG columnar defenses add a safety‑oriented
interrupt repertoire that is recommended for safe instantiation.

## P1 — Hippocampal rollouts (explicit trajectories)
Evidence: Hippocampal place-cell sequences replay in sleep and waking and can depict future paths to goals.  
REE implication: Support for hippocampus as the explicit multi-step rollout generator.  
Sources: [Wilson & McNaughton 1994](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8036517/), [Foster & Wilson 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16474382/), [Pfeiffer & Foster 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23594744/).

## P2 — Post-commitment viability mapping
Evidence: Replay occurs immediately after experience and is temporally structured, consistent with updating a path model after execution.  
REE implication: Hippocampus can update a viability map from executed trajectories without being a value optimizer.  
Sources: [Foster & Wilson 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16474382/), [Wilson & McNaughton 1994](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8036517/).

## P3 — Selection and gating of action
Evidence: Basal ganglia direct/indirect pathways modulate action initiation and suppression; pathways co-activate during action.  
REE implication: E3-style selection can be interpreted as a gating mechanism rather than a value module.  
Sources: [Kravitz et al. 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20613723/), [Cui et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354054/).

## P4 — Precision/arousal control (control-plane analogue)
Evidence: Locus coeruleus (LC) activity correlates with attention and performance fluctuations in cognitive tasks.  
REE implication: Precision and gain control can be modeled as state-dependent tuning rather than representational content.  
Sources: [Aston-Jones et al. 1994](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8027789/), [Usher et al. 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9915705/).

Evidence: Self-generated tactile sensations are centrally canceled via prediction of sensory consequences.  
REE implication: SELF_SENSORY vs WORLD separation and SELF_IMPACT comparison are biologically grounded.  
Sources: [Blakemore et al. 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10196573/).

## P6 — Prediction-error signaling (predictive coding)
Evidence: Cortical circuits can be modeled as top-down predictions with feedforward error residuals.  
REE implication: Prediction vs prediction-error channels are a viable architectural primitive.  
Sources: [Rao & Ballard 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10195184/).

## P7 — Reward prediction error signals (dopamine)
Evidence: Dopamine neurons encode errors in reward prediction and timing during learning.  
REE implication: Reward-like signals are naturally emergent prediction-error channels, not required as explicit objectives.  
Sources: [Hollerman & Schultz 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10195164/), [Bayer & Glimcher 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15996553/).

Sources: [Gallese et al. 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8800951/), [Rizzolatti et al. 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8713554/).

## P9 — Empathy via shared affective components
Evidence: Observing another’s pain engages affective pain circuitry without primary sensory pain activation.  
REE implication: Empathy coupling can weight inferred other-harm without full sensory equivalence.  
Sources: [Singer et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14976305/).

## P10 — Joint attention as developmental anchor

Sources: [Kirby et al. 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18667697/).

## P12 — Papez-like provenance gating / confabulation
Evidence: The Papez circuit is a memory-related loop linking hippocampus, fornix, mammillary bodies, anterior thalamus,
cingulate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. Confabulation is characterized as a memory disorder involving failure of
reality filtering (suppression of currently irrelevant memory traces).  
REE implication: A Papez-like loop can be treated as a provenance gate that withholds high-precision commitment unless
trace/ordering support exists.  
Sources: [NCBI Bookshelf: Papez circuit overview](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK575732/), [Papez circuit MRI anatomy (PMC)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10569190/), [Schnider 2003, Nat Rev Neurosci](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1179), [Schnider & Ptak 1999, Nat Neurosci](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0799_677).

## P13 — Arcuate fasciculus and language pathways
Evidence: Comparative DTI shows a prominent temporal projection of the human arcuate fasciculus that is much smaller or
absent in nonhuman primates. Language is best described as a dual dorsal–ventral system, with dorsal streams supporting
sensorimotor mapping and ventral streams supporting comprehension; conduction aphasia data suggest the arcuate is
important but not sufficient alone.  
REE implication: a dorsal‑style sequence → motor channel is a useful nudge for language emergence, but the system should
remain distributed rather than relying on a single tract analog.  
Sources: [Rilling et al. 2008, Nat Neurosci](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn2072), [Hickok & Poeppel 2007, Nat Rev Neurosci](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2113), [Bernal & Ardila 2009, Brain](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/132/9/2309/359715).

## P14 — Forward/reverse hippocampal sequences at decision points

Sources: [Diba & Buzsáki 2007, Nat Neurosci](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1961).

## P15 — Replay prioritization for planning

REE implication: control-plane parameters can bias which trajectories are replayed without turning replay into a
value‑optimizing module.  
Sources: [Mattar & Daw 2018, Nat Neurosci](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0232-z).

## P16 — Sleep replay biasing and consolidation

REE implication: replay scheduling can favor fragile trajectories, aligning with a stability‑preserving control plane.  
Sources: [Schapiro et al. 2018, Nat Commun](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06213-1).

## P18 — Basal ganglia gating (direct/indirect pathways)
Evidence: Optogenetic activation of direct vs indirect pathways bidirectionally regulates movement initiation and
suppression; pathways co‑activate during action selection.  
REE implication: E3-style selection can be modeled as gating among competing trajectories rather than scalar valuation.
Co‑activation argues against a simple go/no‑go switch and supports competing pathway dynamics.  
Sources: [Kravitz et al. 2010, Nature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20613723/), [Friend & Kravitz 2014, Trends Neurosci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24816402/).

## P19 — Hyperdirect “stop” pathway

commitment without re‑evaluating the full selection landscape.  
Sources: [Aron & Poldrack 2006, J Neurosci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16510720/), [Chen et al. 2020, Neuron](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32155442/).

## P20 — LC‑NE adaptive gain (explore/exploit)
Evidence: LC‑NE exhibits tonic vs phasic modes associated with exploration vs exploitation, respectively.  
REE implication: tonic vs phasic gain modes can be modeled as baseline vs volatility control channels, and gain can regulate
exploration pressure and commitment stability. This supports separating arousal baseline from volatility sensitivity.  
Sources: [Aston‑Jones & Cohen 2005, Annu Rev Neurosci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16022602/).

## P21 — Precision‑weighting and psychosis
Evidence: Precision‑weighting of prediction errors benefits learning and is impaired in psychosis; dopamine modulates
this precision weighting.  
REE implication: misallocated precision is a plausible mechanism for hallucination‑like failures.  
Sources: [Haarsma et al. 2020, Mol Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-0803-8), [Fletcher & Frith 2009, Nat Rev Neurosci](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2536).

## P24 — PPN as brainstem arousal/locomotion hub
Evidence: The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) is a heterogeneous brainstem hub with reciprocal basal ganglia
connections and roles in cortical arousal, behavioral state, and locomotion.  
REE implication: control‑plane signals can reach motor/arousal systems via a brainstem hub that modulates state and gait,
supporting a separation between readiness/motor gating and global arousal.  
Sources: [Benarroch 2013, Neurology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23509047/), [eLife 2024 PPN basal ganglia inputs](https://elifesciences.org/articles/102308).

## P26 — Ascending reticular activating system (ARAS)
Evidence: The ARAS mediates arousal and has brainstem→thalamus/hypothalamus/basal‑forebrain pathways; lesions cause coma.  
REE implication: control‑plane arousal gating can be modeled as a distributed brainstem pathway rather than a single node,
reinforcing the idea that arousal is a channel, not a scalar switch.

## P27 — Dorsal raphe 5‑HT arousal
Evidence: Dorsal raphe serotonin neurons mediate CO2‑induced arousal from sleep.  
REE implication: serotonergic control channels can directly gate arousal independent of respiration, supporting an arousal
channel that is not reducible to immediate safety or precision signals.  
Sources: [DRN 5‑HT neurons mediate CO2 arousal, J Neurosci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29378860/).

## P28 — PAG defensive control
Evidence: The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is organized into columns with distinct defensive repertoires. Dorsolateral/lateral
columns are associated with active defense (flight/fight), while ventrolateral columns are associated with passive defense
(freezing/immobility) and analgesia. PAG also provides ascending influence on fear learning.  
REE implication: a brainstem defensive hub can feed rapid interrupt and affective bias into control‑plane gating, with
multiple defensive repertoires available at low latency.  
Status: **Safety extension** (recommended; not required for minimal cognition).  
Sources: [Motta et al. 2017, Neurosci Biobehav Rev](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28434586/), [Carrive 1993, Behav Brain Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8136048/).

## P35 — Phase‑amplitude coupling (PAC) pitfalls
Evidence: Some PAC measures can produce spurious coupling due to nonsinusoidal waveforms.

## P36 — Primate hippocampus oscillatory differences
Evidence: In macaque CA1, theta and gamma bands are segregated by behavioral state; beta2/slow gamma dominates active search, and theta dominates quiescence.  
REE implication: Do not hard‑code rodent theta–gamma coupling as a universal hippocampal mechanism; consider species/state differences.
