## Status Snapshot (2026-03-20)

- **V2 complete.** All three hard-stop criteria triggered after EXQ-028. Governance cycle
  run 2026-03-19: 7 decisions applied, V3-pending gate lifted, ARC-024 and SD-010
  registered.
- **V3 active.** 73 experiments run (through EXQ-059). Substrate SDs 004/005/006/007
  implemented. EXQ-030b PASS validated V3-form SD-003 attribution pipeline
  (attribution_gap=0.035, world_forward_r2=0.947). Current focus: SD-010 implementation
  (harm stream separation) to unblock ~10 pending FAILs.
- **Q-020 adjudicated:** ARC-007 strict (2026-03-16). HippocampalModule generates
  value-flat proposals; terrain sensitivity is a consequence of navigating
  residue-shaped z_world, not a separate hippocampal value signal.
- **17 pending FAILs** awaiting review (generated 2026-03-20). Root cause cluster:
  fused z_world containing harm signal → SD-010 substrate debt.
- `REE_assembly` is the canonical governance + specification repo. Current V3 roadmap
  is in §REE-v3 below; `v2_v3_transition_roadmap.md` is now historical.

---

## Status Snapshot (2026-02-28) — archived

- `REE_assembly` is the canonical governance + specification repo.
- `ree-v1-minimal` has served as the qualification harness: 8 genuine experiments
  completed (EXQ-000 through EXQ-007), 4 PASS, 4 informative FAIL (substrate-limited).
- Substrate debt items SD-001, SD-002, SD-003 registered. V1 has reached saturation
  for the claims it was designed to test. Further V1 runs (EXQ-008/009) complete the
  current evidence cycle; extended-seed reruns (EXQ-010–013) are low-priority confidence
  accumulation.
- V2 cutover gates passed 2026-02-18 but cutover was deferred. Correct decision: V2
  specification needs redesigning (Step 2.0, below) before implementation begins.
- JEPA integration guidance remains convergence-first: source-method details live in
  `REE_convergence`; `REE_assembly` keeps REE-first canonical contracts and adjudication
  outputs.

---

## Roadmap Discipline

**Each step must be completed in sequence. Before starting the next step:**

1. Record what was learned (update GOVERNANCE_STATE.md, substrate debt register, any
   affected claims).
2. Update this roadmap to reflect that learning — revise subsequent steps if the
   evidence changes what they should be.
3. Make the update-roadmap action explicit in the exit criteria of every step.

The roadmap is not a fixed plan; it is a living document that is deliberately updated at
each step boundary. Steps may be added, split, or reordered as understanding grows.

---

## Phase Definitions

### REE-v1 ✓ (completed purpose: qualification baseline)

**Primary role:** validate whether proposed mechanisms produce expected directional
effects under controlled conditions.

**Outcome:** useful for signal discovery and contract hardening. Not sufficient as final
architecture target due to stress-lane conflicts, limited environment breadth, and
accumulated substrate debt (SD-001, SD-002, SD-003). Four genuine PASSes confirm core
signal structure; four informative FAILs confirm substrate resolution limits, not
architecture failures.

**Post-V1 learning incorporated into roadmap:**
- E2/hippocampus conflation (SD-001) prevents clean mechanistic isolation
- E1/E2 mutual constitution (SD-002) reframes timescale-separation interpretation
- E2 self-attribution substrate (SD-003) is an unmet V2 design requirement
- V1 stateless grid cannot surface persistent agent causal footprint
- MECH-057 (control completion) requires multi-step environment with genuine commitment
  pressure; needs richer substrate before further testing

---

### REE-v2 ✓ (completed purpose: V2 qualification)

**V2 series closed after EXQ-028 (2026-03-19).** All three hard-stop criteria met.
Governance cycle completed 2026-03-19.

#### Step 2.0 — V2 Redesign ✓

**Primary role:** Produce an updated V2 specification that incorporates V1 learning.
The original V2 spec (representation-interface contract) remains in scope, but the
design must now account for SD-001/002/003 and explicitly address what V2 must deliver
to make future self-attribution and self-modelling experiments possible.

**In-scope:**
- Redesign V2 architecture to resolve SD-001: E2 separated as pure transition MLP,
  HippocampalModule created as distinct component of E3 complex
- Revise V2 entry criteria to include SD-003 requirements (see below)
- Produce first-pass V2 implementation spec: subsystem boundaries, required metrics,
  failure gates
- Define the persistent-causal-footprint environment requirement (SD-003)
- Capture mutual constitution (SD-002) in architecture documents

**Out-of-scope:**
- Implementation (code changes happen in Step 2.1 onward)
- New V1 experiments beyond EXQ-008/009

**Exit criteria:**
- Updated V2 implementation spec document exists with SD-001/002/003 addressed
- V2 entry criteria revised (see below)
- This roadmap updated with Step 2.1–2.5 refined based on redesign output
- GOVERNANCE_STATE.md SD-003 entry complete ✓ (done 2026-02-28)

**Outcome:** ✓ Complete. V2 spec produced (`docs/architecture/ree_v2_spec.md`). SD-001/002/003
addressed in design. Steps 2.1–2.5 scoped.

---

#### Step 2.1 — E2 Separation (SD-001 resolution) ✓

**Primary role:** Refactor E2 into a pure fast transition model. Create HippocampalModule
as a distinct component of the E3 complex. Close SD-001.

**In-scope:**
- `E2FastPredictor` → pure forward predictor: `forward(z, a) → z_next` (cerebellum-like)
- `HippocampalModule` (new) → trajectory proposal by navigating affective terrain; not
  by running transition predictions
- Counterfactual E2 querying made architecturally possible: `e2.forward(z, a_cf)`
- SD-001 closed in GOVERNANCE_STATE.md

**Out-of-scope:**
- Full E3 complex redesign (Step 2.2+)
- Self-attribution experiments (Step 2.4)

**Exit criteria:**
- E2 callable independently with arbitrary action input
- HippocampalModule exists as separate class
- Existing EXQ PASS results replicated on refactored substrate (parity check)
- Roadmap updated with any discoveries

**Outcome:** ✓ Complete. E2 is a pure fast transition MLP on z_self. HippocampalModule
created as distinct E3 component. SD-001 closed.

---

#### Step 2.2 — Representation Interface Contract ✓

**Primary role:** Lock stable representation-interface contract for sensing adapters
and E1/E2 latent prediction. This is the original primary V2 role, now sequenced after
E2 separation.

**In-scope:**
- Sensor adapters mapped to JEPA-like context/target latent interfaces
- E1/E2 representation-reference integration contract (`IMPL-022`)
- Stable output streams for latent prediction error and uncertainty
- Run-pack/adapter-signal compliance and calibration metrics

**Out-of-scope:**
- Full control-plane completion
- Hippocampal/E3 commitment architecture
- Full ethical arbitration dynamics

**Exit criteria:**
- Representation-interface contract stable across qualification and stress lanes
- Uncertainty/error streams calibrated and non-gamed across distribution shifts
- No unresolved adapter contract drift
- Roadmap updated with any discoveries

**Outcome:** ✓ Complete. MECH-059 PASS confirmed E1 precision and E3 confidence are
structurally independent. Representation interface stable.

---

#### Step 2.3 — Persistent Causal Environment ✓

**Primary role:** Upgrade the environment substrate so that persistent agent causal
footprint is present — actions at step N affect the landscape at step N+k in ways
that require disambiguation from independent environment change. This is the
prerequisite for SD-003 experiments.

**In-scope:**
- Environment design where agent-caused and environment-caused transitions are
  structurally distinct and must be separated for correct attribution
- Validation that E2 (now pure transition model from Step 2.1) can be queried
  counterfactually against this environment

**Out-of-scope:**
- Full self-attribution claim testing (Step 2.4)

**Exit criteria:**
- Environment exists with persistent agent causal footprint
- Baseline experiments confirm agent-caused / environment-caused distinguishability
- Roadmap updated with any discoveries

**Outcome:** ✓ Complete. CausalGridWorld implemented with persistent agent causal
footprint. EXQ-018 PASS confirmed agent-caused/environment-caused distinguishability.

---

#### Step 2.4 — Self-Attribution Substrate ✓ (V2 partial; V3 form validated)

**Primary role:** Implement and test counterfactual E2 querying for self-modelling.
First genuine experiments on self-attribution claims. Close SD-003.

**In-scope:**
- Counterfactual E2 queries integrated into agent decision loop
- First genuine experiments isolating agent-caused vs environment-caused harm
- Self-attribution claim coverage (claims to be identified during Step 2.0 redesign)
- SD-003 closed in GOVERNANCE_STATE.md

**Exit criteria:**
- At least one genuine PASS on a self-attribution claim
- E2 counterfactual querying demonstrated experimentally
- Roadmap updated with any discoveries

**Outcome:** ✓ Partial / hard stop. EXQ-027 FAIL triggered V2 hard stop: E2 cannot
discriminate agent-caused harm in z_gamma; SD-005 substrate required. V2
self-attribution experiments concluded. V3-form SD-003 validated at EXQ-030b PASS
(2026-03-18): attribution_gap=0.035, world_forward_r2=0.947. Full SD-003 achieved on
V3 substrate with z_world separation.

---

#### Step 2.5 — V2 Qualification ✓

**Primary role:** Genuine experiment coverage across core V2 claims. Sufficient evidence
to make V3 entry decision.

**Exit criteria:**
- Representation interface stable across qualification and stress lanes (from Step 2.2)
- Self-attribution substrate tested (from Step 2.4)
- Governance confidence above provisional thresholds for core V2 claims
- **Roadmap updated with V1+V2 learnings before V3 begins**
- V3 entry decision made explicitly

**Outcome:** ✓ Complete. V2 series closed after EXQ-028. 15 genuine V2 experiments
(EXQ-014–028): 5 structural-separation PASSes, 9 FAILs (all substrate-limited by
z_gamma conflation or SD-004 absence). Governance cycle 2026-03-19: 7 decisions
applied. V3 entry formally made.

---

### REE-v3 ← **current phase** (control completion + full attribution)

**Primary role:** Implement full attribution pipeline, control-plane heartbeat architecture,
and E3 commitment/accountability on the z_self/z_world split substrate (SD-004/005).

#### Step 3.0 — V3 Substrate Implementation ✓

SD-004 (E2 action objects; HippocampalModule navigates action-object space O), SD-005
(z_gamma → z_self + z_world split), SD-006 (asynchronous multi-rate heartbeat,
time-multiplexed phase 1), SD-007 (ReafferencePredictor for perspective-corrected
z_world). Q-020 adjudicated: ARC-007 strict (2026-03-16). CausalGridWorld extended
to V3 environment. EXQ-030b PASS: SD-003 attribution pipeline validated.

#### Step 3.1 — Substrate Debt Resolution ← **current step**

**In-scope:**
- SD-008: alpha_world ≥ 0.9 in LatentStackConfig (default 0.3 suppresses event responses)
- SD-009: event-contrastive CE auxiliary loss for z_world encoder (MECH-100)
- SD-010: harm stream separation — CausalGridWorldV2 with separate harm_obs channel,
  dedicated HarmEncoder → z_harm, E3 takes z_harm as primary input; unblocks ~10 pending FAILs

**Exit criteria:**
- SD-008/SD-009 validated at scale (z_world event selectivity confirmed)
- SD-010 implemented and EXQ-056/058/059 re-run on new substrate (validation)
- 17 pending FAILs from 2026-03-20 batch reviewed; attribution FAIL cluster resolved

#### Step 3.2 — V3 Claim Qualification

**In-scope:**
- ARC-016: E3-derived dynamic precision + end-to-end commitment→behavior behavioral distinction
- MECH-025: action-doing mode probe on V3 substrate
- MECH-057b: completion gate retest
- Q-007: valence-precision interaction
- SD-006: multi-rate loop validation at scale (ARC-023, MECH-089–093)
- MECH-090: beta-gated policy propagation
- ARC-024: harm attribution with SD-010 substrate
- Full V3-EXQ series (V3-EXQ-001 through V3-EXQ-010 as designed in transition roadmap)

**Exit criteria:**
- Governance confidence above provisional thresholds for core V3 control claims
- V3-pending claims adjudicated (ARC-007, ARC-016, ARC-018, MECH-025, MECH-033, Q-007)
- **Roadmap updated with V1+V2+V3 learnings before V4 begins**

#### Step 3.3 — V3 Governance Cycle and V4 Entry Decision

**Exit criteria to start V4:**
- Robust separation of exploratory simulation vs committed learning
- Stable behaviour under adversarial trajectory pressure
- Governance confidence above provisional thresholds for core control claims
- V4 entry decision made explicitly

---

### REE-v4 (later: social and institutional complexity)

**Primary role:** Scale to richer multi-agent coupling, language-mediated coordination,
and institutional constraints.

**Exit criteria:** To be defined during V3, informed by what V3 delivers.

---

## V2 Entry Criteria (revised 2026-02-28)

Original criteria (all still required):
- Representation-interface contract stable across qualification and stress lanes
- Uncertainty/error streams calibrated and non-gamed across distribution shifts
- No unresolved adapter contract drift

Added from V1 learning:
- **SD-001 resolved**: E2 implemented as pure isolatable transition model; HippocampalModule
  exists as separate component of E3 complex
- **SD-003 requirement**: Counterfactual E2 querying architecturally possible
  (`e2.forward(z, a_counterfactual)` callable independently)
- **Persistent causal environment**: environment substrate provides persistent agent
  causal footprint, enabling agent-caused vs environment-caused transition disambiguation

---

## Repository Roles

- `REE_assembly`: canonical claims, architecture docs, evidence matrix, governance outputs.
- `ree-v3`: **primary qualification lane** for V3 experiments and claim coverage. Default
  branch: `main`. Results go to `REE_assembly/evidence/experiments/`.
- `ree-v2`: transitional reference. V2 series complete (EXQ-014–028). No new experiments.
- `ree-v1-minimal`: legacy baseline/reference harness. No new mechanism development.
- `ree-experiments-lab`: **ARCHIVED** 2026-02-26. Synthetic scaffolding only; do not use.

---

## Immediate Work Queue (This Cycle)

**Current step: 3.1 — Substrate Debt Resolution**

1. **Implement SD-010** (harm stream separation): CausalGridWorldV2 with separate
   `harm_obs` channel, dedicated HarmEncoder → z_harm, E3 wired to z_harm as primary
   input. Re-queue EXQ-056/058/059 on new substrate.
2. **Review 17 pending FAILs** (generated 2026-03-20). Prioritise SD-010 cluster
   (EXQ-044/045/047/056/058/059) and structural mechanism FAILs (EXQ-048/049/050/051/052).
   Update `review_tracker.json` and re-run `generate_pending_review.py`.
3. **SD-008 validation at scale**: confirm alpha_world ≥ 0.9 in LatentStackConfig
   default; run targeted z_world event-selectivity experiment if not yet done.
4. **SD-009**: design and queue event-contrastive CE auxiliary loss experiment (MECH-100).

---

## Open Questions

- **SD-010 HarmEncoder architecture**: should z_harm be a separate stream alongside
  z_world and z_self, or should it route through z_world after SD-010? The `l_space.md`
  architecture suggests a four-stream model (z_self, z_world, z_beta, z_harm).
- **ARC-016 E3-derived precision**: EXQ-038 FAIL — root cause (precision invariance)
  needs analysis before designing the next precision-regime experiment.
- **SD-006 phase 2**: time-multiplexed multi-rate is phase 1; true asynchronous
  execution (thread-based or event-loop) is still open. HTA (hierarchical temporal
  abstraction) is the recommended direction but not yet designed.
