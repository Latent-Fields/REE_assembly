# Roadmap

## REE‑v0 (specification)

- [x] Minimum instantiation specification
- [x] Architecture notes
- [x] Toy environment contract

## REE‑v1 (reference implementation)

Goal: a runnable baseline that demonstrates moral residue as persistent curvature.

- [ ] Implement toy world environment
- [ ] Implement E1/E2 latent stack and rollout model
- [ ] Implement E3 trajectory selection with scoring
- [ ] Implement residue field \(\phi(z)\) and update
- [ ] Provide simple evaluation scripts and plots

## REE‑v2 (embodied / social)

- [ ] Adapter for embodied sensors (simulated first)
- [ ] Richer other-model inference (without privileged channels)
- [ ] Offline reprojection (sleep-like replay) for residue calibration

## Research notes

- Map precision gains \(\alpha_k\) to neuromodulatory analogues in analysis documents.
- Keep implementation claims modest; prefer falsifiable behavioral tests.
