- **REE:** Reflective‑Ethical Engine.
- **E1:** Deep predictor (long-horizon context model).
- **E2:** Fast predictor (short-horizon reflex model).
- **E3:** Trajectory selector (planning and commitment module).
- **L-space:** Fused latent manifold stratified by prediction depth.
- **Rollout:** Explicit multi-step trajectory sequence generated by hippocampal systems; used for candidate futures.
- **Forward prediction:** Short-horizon conditional transition kernel (typically 1–2 steps) produced by E2; used to seed hippocampal rollouts.
- **\(\zeta\):** Selected trajectory (latent + hippocampal action rollout).
- **\(\mathcal{F}\):** Reality constraint (computable proxy for VFE (Variational Free Energy)).
- **\(M\):** Legacy ethical cost proxy (predicted degradation of self/other variables). Retained for traceability and evaluation; current canonical framing does not require an explicit ethical cost term (see `docs/architecture/e3.md`).
- **Residue \(R\):** Persistent curvature term produced by ethical consequence history (legacy formulations tie this to \(M\)).
- **\(\phi(z)\):** Residue dent field over latent space.
- **Precision \(\alpha_k\):** Depth-indexed gain controlling error weighting / entropy.

## External Vocabulary Alignment (JEPA to REE)

<a id="impl-020"></a>
### Formal Alignment Glossary (IMPL-020)

Purpose: align terminology between latent predictive world-model research (JEPA framing) and REE so claims are
structurally interoperable without forcing conceptual merger.

#### 1. Representation layer

| JEPA term | REE term | Alignment note |
|---|---|---|
| Embedding / latent representation | L-space | Both refer to abstract latent manifolds where prediction happens without raw sensory reconstruction. |
| Encoder | E1 deep integrative predictor | Both construct representational geometry; REE E1 adds slow cross-modal and cross-temporal synthesis. |
| Target embedding | Projected future L-state | JEPA predicts latent targets; REE predicts future state trajectories in latent space. |

#### 2. Predictive dynamics

| JEPA term | REE term | Alignment note |
|---|---|---|
| Latent predictor | E2 fast predictive generator | Both implement rapid transition modeling in latent space. |
| Joint embedding alignment loss | L-state prediction error signal | REE does not require a single scalar objective but still uses prediction deviation for adaptation. |
| Invariant structure learning | Coherence preservation across time | JEPA invariance pressure maps to REE long-horizon structural coherence pressure. |

#### 3. Temporal structure

| JEPA term | REE term | Alignment note |
|---|---|---|
| Temporal/video JEPA | Multi-timescale predictive integration (E1+E2 coupling) | Both move from static inference toward trajectory prediction. |
| Context window | Current L-state with memory integration | REE extends context with deeper temporal and replay-linked integration. |

#### 4. Agency extension layer

| JEPA (agentic extension) | REE term | Alignment note |
|---|---|---|
| Action-conditioned prediction | Efference/reafference loop | Required for embodied intervention-stable prediction. |
| Self-model in latent manifold | Self L-state modeling | REE treats this as viability-critical, not optional. |
| Control mechanism (implicit gap) | E3 trajectory selector + control plane | REE explicitly defines trajectory arbitration and gating under uncertainty. |

#### 5. Stability and constraint

| JEPA term | REE term | Alignment note |
|---|---|---|
| Representation collapse avoidance | Viability constraint | REE generalizes collapse risk from embeddings to behavior and multi-agent dynamics. |
| Predictable invariants | Shared modelability | REE extends invariance to mutual predictability between agents. |
| Training objective | Long-horizon coherence bias | REE frames this as destabilization constraints rather than reward optimization. |

#### 6. Multi-agent extension

| JEPA extension need | REE term | Alignment note |
|---|---|---|
| Modeling other agents | Other L-state modeling | Mutual modeling is foundational for REE social/ethical dynamics. |
| Multi-agent stability (unspecified) | Ethical stability constraint | REE treats preservation of shared predictability as a viability requirement. |

#### 7. Meta-architecture summary

| Layer | JEPA | REE |
|---|---|---|
| Representation | latent embedding | L-space |
| Fast prediction | latent predictor | E2 |
| Deep integration | encoder hierarchy | E1 |
| Error correction | alignment loss | prediction-error routing |
| Action integration | optional extension | core requirement |
| Trajectory control | not defined | E3 |
| Stability principle | invariant learning | long-horizon coherence |

#### 8. Divergence points

- JEPA is typically objective-centric; REE is constraint-centric.
- JEPA does not require ethical modeling; REE treats ethical stability as structural viability.
- JEPA does not define control-plane arbitration; REE treats control arbitration as irreducible.

#### 9. Minimal interoperability principle

A JEPA-derived world model can serve as REE E1/E2 representational substrate.  
REE contributes control-plane architecture, self-impact attribution, trajectory constraints, and multi-agent stability
modeling.

#### 10. Terminology harmonization proposal

- latent embedding <-> L-space
- prediction error <-> L-state deviation
- action-conditioned prediction <-> efference/reafference loop
- invariant representation <-> coherence-preserving state
