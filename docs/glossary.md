- **REE:** Reflective‑Ethical Engine.
- **E1:** Deep predictor (long-horizon context model).
- **E2:** Fast predictor (short-horizon reflex model).
- **E3:** Trajectory selector (planning and commitment module).
- **L-space:** Fused latent manifold stratified by prediction depth.
- **Rollout:** Explicit multi-step trajectory sequence generated by hippocampal systems; used for candidate futures.
- **Forward prediction:** Short-horizon conditional transition kernel (typically 1–2 steps) produced by E2; used to seed hippocampal rollouts.
- **Commit boundary:** Authority transition where irreversible action dispatch or privilege-bearing durable-write
  eligibility begins for a specific `commit_id`; not a requirement to pause stream processing.
- **Pre-commit channel:** Continuous rehearsal/simulation error stream used for search, gating, and arbitration; cannot
  directly perform durable responsibility-bearing writes.
- **Post-commit channel:** Continuous realized-outcome/reafference stream joined to commit lineage and allowed to drive
  durable attribution/policy/residue updates.
- **Superseding commit:** A new commit event that interrupts/re-routes a previously dispatched commit; extends lineage
  history without erasing accountability of the earlier commit.
- **\(\zeta\):** Selected trajectory (latent + hippocampal action rollout).
- **\(\mathcal{F}\):** Reality constraint (computable proxy for VFE (Variational Free Energy)).
- **\(M\):** Legacy ethical cost proxy (predicted degradation of self/other variables). Retained for traceability and evaluation; current canonical framing does not require an explicit ethical cost term (see `docs/architecture/e3.md`).
- **Residue \(R\):** Persistent curvature term produced by ethical consequence history (legacy formulations tie this to \(M\)).
- **\(\phi(z)\):** Residue dent field over latent space.
- **Precision \(\alpha_k\):** Depth-indexed gain controlling error weighting / entropy.

## External Vocabulary Alignment (JEPA to REE)

<a id="impl-020"></a>
### Formal Alignment Glossary (IMPL-020)

Purpose: align terminology between latent predictive world-model research (JEPA framing) and REE so claims are
structurally interoperable without forcing conceptual merger.

Canonical scope:
- maintain only adjudicated JEPA-to-REE term translations needed by canonical REE docs and contracts,
- keep source-specific and exploratory translation drafts in `REE_convergence`,
- promote external translation changes back through convergence packets before canonical adoption.

#### Canonical term translation set

| JEPA term | REE term | Canonical interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Embedding / latent representation | L-space | Shared latent manifold where prediction and rollout preparation operate. |
| Encoder / context-target encoder | E1 deep integrative predictor | Slow cross-modal and cross-temporal integration path. |
| Latent predictor | E2 fast predictive generator | Short-horizon latent transition generator. |
| Target embedding | Projected future L-state | Latent future target used for predictive alignment. |
| Joint embedding alignment loss / latent prediction error | L-state prediction error signal (PE routing input) | Deviation signal for adaptation without requiring one global scalar objective. |
| Temporal/video JEPA context | Multi-timescale predictive integration (E1+E2 coupling) | Coupled short- and long-horizon trajectory modeling. |
| Action-conditioned prediction | Efference/reafference loop | Embodied prediction stream conditioned on intervention. |
| Self-model in latent manifold | Self L-state modeling | Viability-critical self representation. |
| Control mechanism (implicit gap in JEPA) | E3 trajectory selector + control plane | Explicit trajectory arbitration and gating under uncertainty. |
| Representation collapse avoidance / predictable invariants | Viability constraint + shared modelability | Stability requirements spanning single- and multi-agent conditions. |
| Multi-agent stability requirement | Ethical stability constraint | Preservation of shared predictability as a viability condition. |

#### Divergence points

- JEPA is typically objective-centric; REE is constraint-centric.
- JEPA does not require ethical modeling; REE treats ethical stability as structural viability.
- JEPA does not define control-plane arbitration; REE treats control arbitration as irreducible.

#### Minimal interoperability principle

A JEPA-derived world model can serve as REE E1/E2 representational substrate.  
REE contributes control-plane architecture, self-impact attribution, trajectory constraints, and multi-agent stability
modeling.

#### Wording and boundary policy

For v2-facing docs and user-facing interactions:

- use JEPA-first wording at first mention with inline REE translation:
  - `JEPA term (REE term)`
- keep REE schema keys stable in machine contracts.
- keep extended source-level term tables in `REE_convergence`:
  - `sources/jepa/glossary.md`
  - `translations/glossary_master.md`
- require convergence packet references for canonical JEPA terminology updates.
