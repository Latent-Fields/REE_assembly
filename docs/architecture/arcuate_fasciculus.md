This document treats the arcuate fasciculus (AF) as a **functional analog**, not an anatomical requirement. Comparative
and clinical evidence suggest the human AF has expanded temporal projections and a strong dorsal pathway, but language
relies on **distributed dorsal + ventral streams** rather than a single tract (see `docs/notes/evidence_map.md`).

REE interpretation: an AF-like channel provides **fast sequence → motor coupling** that biases the system toward
emergent symbolic communication, while leaving language as a coordination/compression layer rather than a new module.

## Functional nudges for language emergence

- **High-bandwidth sequence-to-motor channel:** fast routing from hippocampal rollouts / E1 sequence summaries into
  E2 articulation affordances.
- **Low-latency correction loop:** rapid self- and other-correction signals that can interrupt or refine outputs before
  commitment.
- **Distributed meaning grounding:** a ventral-style pathway (semantic alignment) coexists with the dorsal sequence
  channel; neither alone is sufficient for language.

These nudges predispose REE to *natural* language emergence under joint attention and coordination pressure without
introducing a dedicated language module.
