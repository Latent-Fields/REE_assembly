# Precision Recalibration

During online action, precision gains (alpha_k) may become miscalibrated.

Sleep enables:
- Restoration of entropy where collapse occurred too early
- Reduction of excessive rigidity
- Rebalancing of commitment vs exploration

This corresponds functionally to monoaminergic regulation:
- Dopamine-like commitment
- Serotonin-like option holding
- Noradrenaline-like reset
- Acetylcholine-like sensory gain tuning
