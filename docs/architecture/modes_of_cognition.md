**Claim Type:** architectural_commitment  
**Scope:** Control-plane regimes that shape cognitive modes  
**Depends On:** ARC-005 (control plane)  
**Status:** provisional  
**Claim ID:** ARC-016

The system should not be understood as running a single mode of cognition. Instead, different cognitive modes emerge from distinct control-plane regimes applied to the same underlying predictive machinery.

These modes are not modules. They are patterns of tuning: changes in gain, horizon, suppression, learning eligibility, and hippocampal gating.
Modes are labels over stable regions of control-channel space (arousal baseline/volatility, readiness, veto, precision/gain), not separate control units.

**Subsystem abstract (core claims):** ARC‑016 establishes modes as control‑plane regimes, while MECH‑025 through MECH‑028
define the action, vigilance, pathological, and ethical implications of those regimes. Supporting context includes ARC‑005
(control plane), ARC‑015 (responsibility flow), INV‑012 (commitment gates responsibility), and MECH‑019/MECH‑020.

This reframing clarified the architecture significantly.

## Action / Doing Mode (MECH-025)

In action-oriented cognition:
- prediction horizons are short,
- fast forward models dominate,
- precision is high for motor-relevant errors,
- learning eligibility is tightly coupled to intervention outcomes,
- hippocampal replay is suppressed or tightly constrained.

This is the mode where:
- predictions become interventions,
- interventions generate attributable consequences,
- responsibility learning is strongest.

Ethically, this is where harm can be caused most directly — and where self-impact attribution must be sharp.

## Ready Vigilance (MECH-026)

Ready vigilance is distinct from action.

In this mode:
- the system maintains high sensitivity to external change,
- prediction horizons remain short-to-mid,
- learning eligibility is conservative,
- motor outputs are inhibited but primed,
- hippocampal injection is limited to context-setting rather than replay.

This is a morally important mode: the system is responsible *for restraint*. Many ethical failures occur not during action, but during the failure to maintain vigilance when action was possible.

## Pathological or Extreme Modes (MECH-027)

The same architecture explains pathological modes:

- Hypervigilance: excessive gain, shortened horizons, suppressed replay.
- Dissociation: weakened self-impact attribution, disrupted binding.
- Rumination: excessive hippocampal replay without control-plane resolution.
- Mania: elevated precision and learning eligibility without constraint.
- Psychosis-like states: failure to suppress internally generated hypotheses.

These are not separate mechanisms; they are mis-tuned control regimes.

This reinforces the idea that ethics, stability, and mental health are co-regulated properties of the same control-plane machinery.

## Architectural Implication (MECH-028)

Modes of cognition should be treated as first-class architectural phenomena.

They are:
- configurations of the control plane,
- applied to shared predictive engines,
- governing when learning is committed,
- and determining where responsibility can accrue.

There is no single “ethical mode.” Ethical behaviour depends on appropriate transitions between modes, and on the preservation of learning across them.

This makes upbringing, environment, fatigue, trauma, and care structurally relevant — not incidental.
