## How to mark runs as reviewed

- PASS/FAIL runs (claim-tagged): add run IDs to `reviewed_run_ids` in review_tracker.json
- ERROR/UNKNOWN/smoke: add queue_id or dir_name to `discussed_experiment_dirs` in review_tracker.json
- Unclaimed manifests (PASS/FAIL, no claim tags): add the manifest stem (filename minus `.json`) to `discussed_experiment_dirs`
- Update `last_review_utc`, then re-run this script to confirm the list clears.

```bash
python scripts/generate_pending_review.py
```
