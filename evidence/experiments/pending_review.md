## Needs diagnosis (ERROR manifests -> /diagnose-errors)

These are durable ERROR-class result manifests on disk -- most commonly a runner-synthesized record for a crash-before-manifest (a script that exited non-zero before writing any manifest; incident V3-EXQ-654e). They are scoring-neutral (no claim tags) so they never weight claim confidence, but each is a real code crash that needs `/diagnose-errors` and a re-queue under a NEW letter. Mark discussed by adding the **manifest stem** (filename minus `.json`) to `discussed_experiment_dirs`.

## How to mark runs as reviewed

- PASS/FAIL runs (claim-tagged): add run IDs to `reviewed_run_ids` in review_tracker.json
- ERROR/UNKNOWN/smoke: add queue_id or dir_name to `discussed_experiment_dirs` in review_tracker.json
- Unclaimed manifests (PASS/FAIL, no claim tags): add the manifest stem (filename minus `.json`) to `discussed_experiment_dirs`
- ERROR manifests (crash-before-manifest / runner ERROR record): run `/diagnose-errors`, re-queue under a NEW letter, then add the manifest stem to `discussed_experiment_dirs`
- Diagnostic self-route flagged (`precondition_unmet` / `vacuous_pass`): adjudicate via `/failure-autopsy` before the label drives a governance action; clearing the run for review does not clear the adjudication flag (the manifest's `interpretation` is the source of truth -- a re-queued successor supersedes it).
- Recorded (non-gating) preconditions: nothing to clear. The run is reviewed and closed by the normal PASS/FAIL route above; the recorded finding is an audit trail to read alongside the result, not a flag to adjudicate.
- Update `last_review_utc`, then re-run this script to confirm the list clears.
