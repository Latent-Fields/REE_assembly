## Decision Details

### ARC-007
- Current status: `active`
- Decision needed: Hold — V3 substrate required before meaningful evidence can be collected
- Why this decision is needed: Claim is flagged v3_pending (explicit manual gate). No promotion or demotion should be applied until this flag is cleared.; directions supports=3, weakens=3, mixed=0, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=1
- Recommendation: `hold_pending_v3_substrate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path).
  - Mark as legacy/deferred if claim is being superseded.
  - Demote to candidate to acknowledge insufficient evidence.
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.360735Z`
- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Path memory ablation PASS (EXQ-024) is real but v3_pending gate applies; ARC-007 requires proper HippocampalModule (SD-004) before conclusive V3 testing.

### ARC-016
- Current status: `provisional`
- Decision needed: Demotion review: provisional -> candidate
- Why this decision is needed: overall_conf=0.545, conflict_ratio=0.947, exp_entries=21, lit_entries=0; directions supports=9, weakens=10, mixed=2, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0.947
- Evidence quality note: V2 EXQ (precision_regime_probe, 2026-03-08): FAIL (partial_support=true, 1/2 criteria). Criterion 1 met: precision gap achieved (1.697, easily). Criterion 2 failed: behavioral distinction absent — HIGH_REGIME (commit_rate=1.0) and LOW_REGIME (commit_rate=0.0) produce identical harm (1.233 vs 1.218). Root cause: precision is externally imposed (not E3-derived), and the commitment-to-action circuit …
- Recommendation: `demote_to_candidate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Demote now (reduces false certainty, destabilizes current roadmap references)
  - Hold and run conflict-resolution suite first (more data, temporary ambiguity)
  - Split into subclaims (isolates conflict, increases registry complexity)
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `pending_user`
- Status note: Prior decision exists but recommendation changed; needs fresh review.
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.361120Z`
- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Precision regime probe FAIL (EXQ-025) is substrate-limited: V3 needs E3-derived dynamic precision and end-to-end commitment→behavior wiring.

### ARC-023
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Hold — V3 substrate required before meaningful evidence can be collected
- Why this decision is needed: Claim has implementation_phase=v3 but no V3 experimental runs yet. No promotion or demotion should be applied until V3 experiments complete.; directions supports=1, weakens=0, mixed=0, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0
- Recommendation: `hold_pending_v3_substrate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path).
  - Mark as legacy/deferred if claim is being superseded.
  - Demote to candidate to acknowledge insufficient evidence.
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.361127Z`
- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Heartbeat architecture claim, V3-scoped by design. No V2 experiment can test multi-rate loop execution.

### ARC-024
- Current status: `provisional`
- Decision needed: Demotion review: provisional -> candidate
- Why this decision is needed: overall_conf=0.542, conflict_ratio=0.923, exp_entries=25, lit_entries=0; directions supports=6, weakens=7, mixed=12, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0.923
- Evidence quality note: EXQ-028 PASS (2026-03-18): Gradient dominance confirmed with random policy on CausalGridWorldV2. mean_dz_world_hazard_approach >> mean_dz_world_none. World generates observable signals before contact events. Direct confirmation that the simulated world must and does produce proxy-gradient fields. EXQ-029 PASS (2026-03-18): E3.harm_eval learned graded danger model on gradient world. none=0.373, app…
- Recommendation: `demote_to_candidate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Demote now (reduces false certainty, destabilizes current roadmap references)
  - Hold and run conflict-resolution suite first (more data, temporary ambiguity)
  - Split into subclaims (isolates conflict, increases registry complexity)
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-19T20:35:00Z`
- Last selected option: Hold at provisional — split resolved conflict scope
- Last rationale: Governance 2026-03-19: ARC-024 split. Claim was spanning two layers — philosophical/foundational (death/love as asymptotic limits, derived from INV-025-029) and behavioral/capability-expansion prediction (love expands under intelligence). The demotion trigger was correct insofar as the behavioral layer needs more work, but the philosophical layer is architecturally well-supported by EXQ-028/029. Resolved by: splitting behavioral prediction to ARC-026 (candidate, v3); retaining ARC-024 at provisional (not demoting to candidate). Conflict experiment pool reflects ARC-026 scope. No demotion applied.

### MECH-025
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Hold — V3 substrate required before meaningful evidence can be collected
- Why this decision is needed: Claim is flagged v3_pending (explicit manual gate). No promotion or demotion should be applied until this flag is cleared.; directions supports=0, weakens=2, mixed=3, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0
- Recommendation: `hold_pending_v3_substrate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path).
  - Mark as legacy/deferred if claim is being superseded.
  - Demote to candidate to acknowledge insufficient evidence.
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.361130Z`
- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Action-doing mode probe FAIL (EXQ-026): V2 substrate lacks the multi-rate loop and heartbeat architecture required to instantiate distinct action-doing mode.

### MECH-057b
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Conflict resolution before promotion
- Why this decision is needed: overall_conf=0.661, conflict_ratio=0.667, exp_entries=6, lit_entries=0; directions supports=2, weakens=1, mixed=3, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0.667
- Evidence quality note: No genuine experiments. This claim is explicitly V3-scoped. The thought-loop trajectory promotion gate requires HippocampalModule to implement a feedback path that suppresses trajectory candidates from being promoted to E3 consideration before hippocampal sequence completion is verified. This path is not present in V1 or V2. V3 primary scope: full HippocampalModule trajectory promotion policy and …
- Recommendation: `hold_candidate_resolve_conflict`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Keep candidate and run conflict-resolution experiments (most balanced)
  - Promote despite conflict (speed, high lock-in risk)
  - Demote to legacy (conservative, may discard useful partial mechanism)
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `pending_user`

### MECH-072
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Promotion review: candidate -> provisional
- Why this decision is needed: overall_conf=0.951, conflict_ratio=0, exp_entries=5, lit_entries=0; directions supports=0, weakens=1, mixed=4, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0
- Evidence quality note: EXQ-028 FAIL (V2): Same root cause as EXQ-027. Foreseeable-harm gating depends on E2 discriminating agent-caused from env-caused harm — impossible without z_self/z_world split (SD-005) and joint SD-003 pipeline. V3 EXQ-054 FAIL (2026-03-20): world_delta_agent=0.01776 ≈ world_delta_env=0.01806 (1.7% difference, below C3 threshold). C4 FAIL: calibration_gap_approach=0. E2 cannot discriminate agent v…
- Recommendation: `promote_to_provisional`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Promote now (faster convergence, risk premature lock-in)
  - Hold until one additional confirming run (better robustness, slower progress)
  - Hold and request targeted literature triangulation (better external grounding, extra delay)
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?

- Status note: Prior decision exists but recommendation changed; needs fresh review.
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.361139Z`
- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Selective residue attribution FAIL (EXQ-028): directly depends on MECH-071 which failed; both require V3 z_self/z_world split (SD-005).

### MECH-091
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Hold — V3 substrate required before meaningful evidence can be collected
- Why this decision is needed: Claim has implementation_phase=v3 but no V3 experimental runs yet. No promotion or demotion should be applied until V3 experiments complete.; directions supports=1, weakens=0, mixed=0, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0

- Options (pros/cons):
  - Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path).
  - Mark as legacy/deferred if claim is being superseded.
  - Demote to candidate to acknowledge insufficient evidence.

### Q-019
- Current status: `open`
- Decision needed: Question narrowing review
- Why this decision is needed: overall_conf=0.869, conflict_ratio=0, exp_entries=0, lit_entries=6; directions supports=5, weakens=0, mixed=1, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0
- Evidence quality note: Open architectural question arising 2026-02-27. Two competing models: (A) Single-gate: BG gate one action endpoint, evaluating three criteria simultaneously (sensorium readiness, thought/trajectory readiness, motor commitment). (B) Three-gate: BG implement three anatomically distinct gating loops — (1) Sensorium loop: limbic/beta-associated, gates what the system attends to — selecting not only fr…
- Recommendation: `narrow_open_question`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Narrow the question into testable sub-questions (higher tractability)
  - Keep broad question (flexibility, weaker experiment planning)
  - Convert one branch into candidate mechanism (progress, possible overcommitment)
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.361158Z`
- Last selected option: Narrow the question into testable sub-questions (higher tractability)
- Last rationale: User confirmed: narrow Q-019 into testable V3 sub-questions targeting the BG three-gate vs single-gate distinction. ARC-021 direction (three distinct loops with incommensurable errors) is the working hypothesis; V3 experiment design should isolate each loop independently before testing full three-gate interaction.
