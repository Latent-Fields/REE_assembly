## Decision Details

### ARC-007
- Current status: `active`
- Decision needed: Hold — V3 substrate required before meaningful evidence can be collected
- Why this decision is needed: Claim is flagged v3_pending (explicit manual gate). No promotion or demotion should be applied until this flag is cleared.; directions supports=2, weakens=1, mixed=0, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0.667
- Recommendation: `hold_pending_v3_substrate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path).
  - Mark as legacy/deferred if claim is being superseded.
  - Demote to candidate to acknowledge insufficient evidence.
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.360735Z`
- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Path memory ablation PASS (EXQ-024) is real but v3_pending gate applies; ARC-007 requires proper HippocampalModule (SD-004) before conclusive V3 testing.

### ARC-023
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Hold — V3 substrate required before meaningful evidence can be collected
- Why this decision is needed: Claim has implementation_phase=v3 but no V3 experimental runs yet. No promotion or demotion should be applied until V3 experiments complete.; directions supports=1, weakens=0, mixed=0, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0
- Recommendation: `hold_pending_v3_substrate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path).
  - Mark as legacy/deferred if claim is being superseded.
  - Demote to candidate to acknowledge insufficient evidence.
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.361127Z`
- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Heartbeat architecture claim, V3-scoped by design. No V2 experiment can test multi-rate loop execution.

### ARC-027
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Promotion review: candidate -> provisional
- Why this decision is needed: overall_conf=0.732, conflict_ratio=0, exp_entries=2, lit_entries=3; directions supports=3, weakens=0, mixed=2, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0
- Evidence quality note: EXQ-027b PASS (2026-03-19): Reafference diagnostic confirms SD-007 hurts E3 calibration when applied to z_world (correction_delta=-0.045, harm_pred_std drops from 0.108 to 0.008). Over-correction explained by applying reafference to a fused stream that includes the nociceptive signal. If z_harm were separate, reafference correction to z_world would not strip the harm signal. EXQ-044 FAIL (2026-03-…
- Recommendation: `promote_to_provisional`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Promote now (faster convergence, risk premature lock-in)
  - Hold until one additional confirming run (better robustness, slower progress)
  - Hold and request targeted literature triangulation (better external grounding, extra delay)
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `pending_user`

### MECH-025
- Current status: `candidate`
- Decision needed: Hold — V3 substrate required before meaningful evidence can be collected

- Recommendation: `hold_pending_v3_substrate`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path).
  - Mark as legacy/deferred if claim is being superseded.
  - Demote to candidate to acknowledge insufficient evidence.
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?

- Last selected option: Wait for V3 substrate implementation (correct path)
- Last rationale: User confirmed hold. Action-doing mode probe FAIL (EXQ-026): V2 substrate lacks the multi-rate loop and heartbeat architecture required to instantiate distinct action-doing mode.

### Q-019
- Current status: `open`

- Why this decision is needed: overall_conf=0.869, conflict_ratio=0, exp_entries=0, lit_entries=6; directions supports=5, weakens=0, mixed=1, unknown=0, conflict_ratio=0
- Evidence quality note: Open architectural question arising 2026-02-27. Two competing models: (A) Single-gate: BG gate one action endpoint, evaluating three criteria simultaneously (sensorium readiness, thought/trajectory readiness, motor commitment). (B) Three-gate: BG implement three anatomically distinct gating loops — (1) Sensorium loop: limbic/beta-associated, gates what the system attends to — selecting not only fr…
- Recommendation: `narrow_open_question`
- Options (pros/cons):
  - Narrow the question into testable sub-questions (higher tractability)
  - Keep broad question (flexibility, weaker experiment planning)
  - Convert one branch into candidate mechanism (progress, possible overcommitment)
- Discussion scope with Codex:
  - Which uncertainty source dominates: model variance, threshold choice, or claim scope?
  - What single additional experiment or literature extraction would most reduce uncertainty?
  - If this decision is wrong, what downstream architecture risk is largest?
- Decision status: `applied`
- Last logged decision: `applied` by `user` at `2026-03-16T18:20:19.361158Z`
- Last selected option: Narrow the question into testable sub-questions (higher tractability)
- Last rationale: User confirmed: narrow Q-019 into testable V3 sub-questions targeting the BG three-gate vs single-gate distinction. ARC-021 direction (three distinct loops with incommensurable errors) is the working hypothesis; V3 experiment design should isolate each loop independently before testing full three-gate interaction.
