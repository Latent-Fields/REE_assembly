# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech060_lit-0021_completion

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-060`

## Source

- *Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control*
- URL: `https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1089910`

## Proposal Link

- proposal_id: `LIT-0021`
- literature_type: `targeted_review_v3_prefrontal_control`

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.78`
- rationale: Empirical conflict-monitoring evidence links ACC signals to downstream control adjustment, strongly supporting control routing claims; mapping to specific habenula-style aversive gating and dual-error channel implementation is still partial. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-060 control arbitration and conflict-monitoring interface. Proposal completion extraction for LIT-0021 scoped to MECH-060.
