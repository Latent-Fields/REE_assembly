## Mapping to REE

- The study provides evidence that conflict-related ACC activity predicts increased subsequent control recruitment (including lateral prefrontal engagement).
- This supports REE control-plane routing (`ARC-005`) where mismatch/conflict-like signals modulate later trajectory commitment (`ARC-003`).
- The data is consistent with modulatory priors and aversive gating hypotheses (`MECH-046`, `MECH-053`) and staged adjustment behavior relevant to `MECH-060`.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- The task and imaging paradigm infer control adjustments but do not directly identify REE module boundaries.
- The study does not directly estimate signed aversive prediction error channels or explicit pre/post-commit learning streams.
- Mapping from ACC conflict signals to amygdala/habenula-specific roles remains inferential.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.78`
- Rationale: robust empirical support for conflict-driven control reconfiguration with moderate specificity gap for REE’s named submodules.
