## Claims Tested

- `ARC-005`
- `ARC-003`
- `MECH-046`
- `MECH-060`

## Source

## Mapping to REE

- The study reports hierarchical organization in prefrontal control (from contextual to episodic branching levels), supporting layered control arbitration.
- This aligns with REE assumptions that precision and policy routing occur at multiple abstraction levels before commitment.
- It strengthens architectural confidence in `ARC-005` and supports staged commitment semantics in `ARC-003` / `MECH-060`.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- The evidence is architectural/functional and does not provide direct computational channel definitions.
- No explicit measurement of amygdala-mode priors or habenula-like aversive gate behavior.
- Task design is constrained relative to naturalistic multi-agent REE settings.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.74`
- Rationale: strong support for hierarchical control structure with moderate translation gap to REE mechanism granularity.
