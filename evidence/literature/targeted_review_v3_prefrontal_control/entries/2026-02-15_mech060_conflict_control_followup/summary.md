# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech060_conflict_control_followup

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-060`

## Source

- John G. Kerns et al. (2004), *Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control*.
- URL: `https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1089910`

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `MECH-060` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-060 control arbitration and conflict-monitoring interface.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.78`
- Rationale: Empirical conflict-monitoring evidence links ACC signals to downstream control adjustment, strongly supporting control routing claims; mapping to specific habenula-style aversive gating and dual-error channel implementation is still partial. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-060 control arbitration and conflict-monitoring interface.
