# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech059_lit-0019_completion

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-059`

## Source

- *What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?*
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1703.04977`

## Proposal Link

- proposal_id: `LIT-0019`
- literature_type: `targeted_review_v3_jepa_mapping_limits`

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.67`
- rationale: Explicit decomposition of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty supports separating precision/uncertainty streams from residual prediction error, but is not JEPA-specific. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-059 confidence-channel decomposition. Proposal completion extraction for LIT-0019 scoped to MECH-059.
