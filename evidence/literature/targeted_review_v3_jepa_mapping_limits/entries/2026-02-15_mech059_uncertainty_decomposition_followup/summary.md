## Claims Tested

- `MECH-059`

## Source

- Alex Kendall et al. (2017), *What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?*.

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `MECH-059` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-059 confidence-channel decomposition.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.67`
- Rationale: Explicit decomposition of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty supports separating precision/uncertainty streams from residual prediction error, but is not JEPA-specific. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-059 confidence-channel decomposition.
