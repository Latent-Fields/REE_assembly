## Claims Tested

- `MECH-056`

## Source

- Gillespie AK et al. (2021), *Hippocampal replay reflects specific past experiences rather than a plan for subsequent choice*.
- DOI: `10.1016/j.neuron.2021.07.029`
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.07.029`

## Source Wording

- Replay favored salient past experience representations and was not a consistent immediate-choice plan signal.

## REE Translation

- Mixed/disconfirming pressure on an over-broad trajectory-first claim: keep the core but add explicit scope boundaries and commitment guardrails.

## Caveat

- Refines mechanism scope rather than invalidating replay relevance outright.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `mixed`
- `confidence`: `0.71`
