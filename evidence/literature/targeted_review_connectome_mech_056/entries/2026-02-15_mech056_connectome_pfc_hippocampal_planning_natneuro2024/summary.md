## Claims Tested

- `MECH-056`

## Source

- Jensen KT, Hennequin G, Mattar MG (2024), *A recurrent network model of planning explains hippocampal replay and human behavior*.
- DOI: `10.1038/s41593-024-01675-7`

## Source Wording

- Planning benefits are explained by prefrontal-controlled hippocampal rollouts that are adaptively engaged.

## REE Translation

- Supports a guarded trajectory-first architecture: replay-like rollouts are useful when explicitly controlled, aligning with a MECH-056 core plus control guardrails.

## Caveat

- Model-based evidence, not direct perturbation of anatomical pathways.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.77`
