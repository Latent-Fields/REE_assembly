## Claims Tested

- `MECH-056`

## Source

- Zhang Y et al. (2021), *Cholinergic suppression of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples impairs working memory*.
- DOI: `10.1073/pnas.2016432118`
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016432118`

## Source Wording

- Septo-hippocampal cholinergic activation suppressed SWRs and impaired performance in a task-phase-dependent way.

## REE Translation

- Supports guardrail implementation where trajectory-first operations are explicitly gated by control state and phase, not globally enabled.

## Caveat

- Focused on one neuromodulatory pathway and one task family.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.75`
