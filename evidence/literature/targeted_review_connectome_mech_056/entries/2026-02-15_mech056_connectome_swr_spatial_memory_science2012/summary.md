## Claims Tested

- `MECH-056`

## Source

- Jadhav SP, Kemere C, German PW, Frank LM (2012), *Awake hippocampal sharp-wave ripples support spatial memory*.
- DOI: `10.1126/science.1217230`
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1217230`

## Source Wording

- Awake SWR interruption produced persistent spatial alternation deficits despite preserved place-field activity.

## REE Translation

- Supports trajectory-first control pressure: replay/trajectory dynamics contribute causally to decision behavior and cannot be replaced by static representational integrity.

## Caveat

- Evidence is strong but from rodent spatial memory paradigms.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.82`
