# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech062_parallel_bg_cortex_loops_annurev1986

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-062`
- `Q-016`

## Source

- Alexander GE, DeLong MR, Strick PL (1986), *Parallel organization of functionally segregated circuits linking basal ganglia and cortex*.
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ne.09.030186.002001`

## Mapping to REE

- Establishes that basal ganglia control is organized into parallel circuit families, not one monolithic gate.
- This directly supports REE's tri-loop gate family architecture.
- It also motivates explicit arbitration policy questions (`Q-016`) when loop-level outputs conflict.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- No explicit computational policy is given for cross-loop conflict resolution.
- The paper is anatomical/functional synthesis, not implementation-level algorithm design.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.83`
- Rationale: high-quality foundational evidence with direct architectural alignment.
