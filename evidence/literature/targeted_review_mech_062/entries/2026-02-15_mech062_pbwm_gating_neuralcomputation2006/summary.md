## Mapping to REE

- Demonstrates selective (channel-specific) gating in prefrontal/basal-ganglia systems.
- Supports REE's non-global gate design and motivates explicit conflict/arbitration policies when multiple gate streams compete.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Model primarily targets cognitive-set gating; motivational and motor loops are not equivalently detailed.
- Does not specify REE commit-token interfaces.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.77`
- Rationale: mechanistically close computational evidence for selective gating, with moderate abstraction gap to tri-loop full-stack REE policy.
