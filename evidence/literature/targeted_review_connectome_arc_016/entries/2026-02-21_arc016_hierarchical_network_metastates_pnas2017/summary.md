# Summary

## Source wording
Brain network dynamics are organized hierarchically over time with metastable transitions.

## REE translation
Supports ARC-016 by backing persistent control regimes and transition structure rather than purely instantaneous control states.

## Mapping caveat
The mapping from inferred metastates to explicit REE mode IDs is model-dependent.
