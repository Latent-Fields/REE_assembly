# Summary

## Source wording
DMN sits along a principal continuous gradient of cortical organization.

## REE translation
Mixed for ARC-016: mode regimes can be real, but should be modeled as regions in a continuous control landscape.

## Mapping caveat
Gradient evidence constrains topology, not explicit switching mechanisms.
