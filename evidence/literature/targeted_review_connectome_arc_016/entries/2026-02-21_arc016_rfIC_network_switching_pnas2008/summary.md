# Summary

## Source wording
Right fronto-insular cortex supports switching between default-mode and central-executive networks.

## REE translation
This supports ARC-016: mode transitions can be implemented as control-plane switching across shared predictive substrates.

## Mapping caveat
This does not directly define a stream-routing contract or prove discrete mode boundaries.
