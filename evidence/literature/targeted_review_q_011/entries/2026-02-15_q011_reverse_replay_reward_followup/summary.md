# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_q011_reverse_replay_reward_followup

## Claims Tested

- `Q-011`

## Source

- R. Ellen Ambrose et al. (2016), *Reverse Replay of Hippocampal Place Cells Is Uniquely Modulated by Changing Reward*.
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.07.047`

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `Q-011` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to Q-011 replay-priority modulation under reward shifts.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `weakens`
- `confidence`: `0.72`
- Rationale: Replay expression tracks reward-change structure rather than a fixed exploration floor, weakening the necessity of a minimum entropy floor as a universal hippocampal constraint. Follow-up extraction scoped to Q-011 replay-priority modulation under reward shifts.
