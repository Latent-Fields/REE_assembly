# Literature Summary: 2026-02-13_lit_0006_q_011_targeted_review

- Dispatch: `LIT-0006`
- Claim linkage: `Q-011`
- Evidence direction assignment: `supports`
- Confidence: `0.61`

## Why this direction
This source is a direct primary argument for entropy-regularized control to preserve action diversity and reduce collapse. That is aligned with Q-011's minimum rollout-diversity floor question.

## Caveats
- Not framed in moral residue terms; translation to REE harm governance is inferential.
- Does not resolve where REE should enforce diversity (control-plane vs hippocampal sampling vs offline consolidation).
