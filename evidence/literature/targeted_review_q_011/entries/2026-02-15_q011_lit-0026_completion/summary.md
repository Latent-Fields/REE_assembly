# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_q011_lit-0026_completion

## Claims Tested

- `Q-011`

## Source

- *Reverse Replay of Hippocampal Place Cells Is Uniquely Modulated by Changing Reward*
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.07.047`

## Proposal Link

- proposal_id: `LIT-0026`
- literature_type: `targeted_review_q_011`

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `weakens`
- `confidence`: `0.72`
- rationale: Replay expression tracks reward-change structure rather than a fixed exploration floor, weakening the necessity of a minimum entropy floor as a universal hippocampal constraint. Follow-up extraction scoped to Q-011 replay-priority modulation under reward shifts. Proposal completion extraction for LIT-0026 scoped to Q-011.
