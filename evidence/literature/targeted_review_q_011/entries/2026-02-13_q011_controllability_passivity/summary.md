# Literature Summary: LIT-0006 / Q-011

## Claim Tested

`Q-011` - Should REE enforce a minimum rollout-diversity floor under repeated unavoidable harm, and where should that pressure be applied?

## Source

- Maier SF, Seligman MEP (2016), *Learned helplessness at fifty: Insights from neuroscience*, Psychological Review.
- DOI: `10.1037/rev0000033`

## Mapping to REE

- The review describes passive-response dominance under repeated uncontrollable aversive exposure (behavioral collapse toward constrained policy patterns).
- This supports the need for an anti-collapse mechanism in REE when repeated harm narrows option exploration.
- It does not directly specify an "entropy floor" mechanism; it mainly supports the problem framing (collapse risk under uncontrollability).

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Human/animal helplessness literature does not directly prescribe rollout-temperature or branching-floor control laws.
- The paper does not adjudicate where intervention should live in REE (control plane vs hippocampal sampling vs offline recovery).
- Evidence is mechanistically informative but only partially constrains implementation details.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `mixed`
- `confidence`: `0.58`
- Rationale: strong relevance to collapse pathology, moderate relevance to exact entropy-floor implementation and locus.
