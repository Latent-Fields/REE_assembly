# Literature Summary: Q-012

## Claim Tested

`Q-012` - Define evidence-backed boundary between `z_theta` and `z_delta`.

## Source

- Margulies DS et al. (2016), *Situating the default-mode network along a principal gradient of macroscale cortical organization*, PNAS.
- DOI: `10.1073/pnas.1608282113`

## Mapping to REE

- The principal cortical gradient spans unimodal sensory/motor regions to transmodal DMN regions.
- This supports a depth split where `z_theta` remains closer to action/perceptual coupling while `z_delta` tracks broader transmodal context and integration.
- The result provides structural guidance for `z_delta`: it should summarize regime-level constraints, not immediate sensory correction.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Gradient geometry does not by itself define control-plane precision gains or update rates.
- Additional work is needed to convert this into explicit interface thresholds (`IFACE-EDGE-020`/`IFACE-EDGE-021`).

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.67`
- Rationale: strong large-scale organizational evidence, but indirect mapping to REE control equations.
