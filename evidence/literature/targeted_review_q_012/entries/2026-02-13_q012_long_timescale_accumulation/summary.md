# Literature Summary: Q-012

## Claim Tested

`Q-012` - What functional role should `z_delta` play relative to `z_theta`?

## Source

- Honey CJ et al. (2012), *Slow cortical dynamics and the accumulation of information over long timescales*, Neuron.
- DOI: `10.1016/j.neuron.2012.08.011`

## Mapping to REE

- Naturalistic ECoG evidence shows sensory regions track short-window features while higher-order regions accumulate information over longer windows.
- This aligns with a `z_theta` (shorter-horizon trajectory/affordance) vs `z_delta` (longer-horizon context/regime) split.
- Supports treating `z_delta` as a slower integrative state not directly rewritten by momentary sensory surprises.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- The source does not define action-commit semantics or ethical residue channels.
- Timescale findings constrain architecture direction but not exact update equations.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.69`
- Rationale: good empirical relevance to timescale boundary question with moderate formalization gap.
