# Literature Summary: 2026-02-13_lit_0004_mech_056_targeted_review

- Dispatch: `LIT-0004`
- Claim linkage: `MECH-056`
- Evidence direction assignment: `supports`
- Confidence: `0.62`

## Why this direction
This paper formalizes enforcing safety constraints at policy/trajectory optimization time. That aligns with MECH-056's design preference to apply control pressure in trajectory feasibility/gating before distorting core representational geometry.

## Caveats
- The paper is not a direct test of REE architecture; linkage is conceptual/mechanistic.
- It does not directly model residue persistence semantics; confidence is moderate.
