# Literature Summary: LIT-0004 / MECH-056

## Claim Tested

`MECH-056` - Prefer trajectory-space and commitment gating before distorting core representational geometry.

## Source

- Quirk GJ, Mueller D (2008), *Neural Mechanisms of Extinction Learning and Retrieval*, Neuropsychopharmacology.
- DOI: `10.1038/sj.npp.1301555`

## Mapping to REE

- The review describes extinction as suppression of expression via circuit-level inhibitory control rather than erasure of the original fear association.
- This maps to REE's preference for constraining enactment trajectories (rollout/commit channels) while preserving rich world models.
- In REE terms, this is closer to "know broadly, enact selectively" than to rewriting core representation.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Biological extinction learning is not a direct formal proof of REE residue geometry or E3 thresholds.
- The mapping is analogical at architecture level, not a one-to-one computational equivalence.
- Source is a review synthesis, not a targeted experiment built around REE claim boundaries.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.66`
- Rationale: direct relevance to suppression-vs-erasure framing, with moderate abstraction gap to REE-specific mechanisms.
