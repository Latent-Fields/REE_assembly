# Literature Summary: MECH-056 / MECH-057

## Claim Tested

- `MECH-056` - Prioritize trajectory and commitment-level shaping over representational distortion.
- `MECH-057` - Keep sensory-channel modulation bounded and primarily orienting/reorienting.

## Mapping to REE

- The review argues organisms actively control sampling policies (what to query, where to orient), not only post-hoc interpretation.
- This supports REE's candidate policy for `IFACE-EDGE-021`: precision/surprise can drive sensory reorientation and sampling intensity without semantic overwrite.
- It also supports trajectory-first residue placement by distinguishing sampling policy control from stable representational content.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Not a direct mechanistic paper on residue or E3 commitment gates.
- Primarily review evidence; conversion to quantitative REE thresholds remains open.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.64`
- Rationale: strong conceptual support for bounded reorientation channels, moderate gap to formal REE parameterization.
