# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech058_byol_target_anchor_followup

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-058`

## Source

- Jean-Bastien Grill et al. (2020), *Bootstrap your own latent: A new approach to self-supervised Learning*.

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `MECH-058` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-058 anchor/predictor timescale separation.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.78`
- Rationale: BYOL directly uses a slow EMA target with a fast online predictor and shows stable learning without collapse, closely matching target-anchor/predictor timescale separation. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-058 anchor/predictor timescale separation.
