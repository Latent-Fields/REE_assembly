# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech061_internal_model_reafference_science1995

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-061`
- `Q-015`

## Source

- Wolpert DM, Ghahramani Z, Jordan MI (1995), *An internal model for sensorimotor integration*.
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7569931`

## Mapping to REE

- The source formalizes predicted-versus-observed sensory consequence comparison around action execution.
- This aligns with REE's post-commit error class (`reafference mismatch`) and supports a boundary where attribution becomes causally anchored.
- Direction is `supports` for `MECH-061` at mechanism level, while token-format specifics remain open (`Q-015`).

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- The paper does not define an explicit commitment token object (`commit_id`, `ttl_steps`, etc.).
- Scope is sensorimotor integration, not generalized cognitive/motivational gate families.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.72`
- Rationale: canonical comparator-model evidence strongly supports post-action attribution channels, with moderate abstraction gap to REE token contract details.
