# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech061_agency_comparator_review_nrn2017

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-061`
- `MECH-060`
- `Q-015`

## Source

- Haggard P (2017), *Sense of agency in the human brain*.
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.14`

## Mapping to REE

- The review synthesizes comparator-style mechanisms linking intention, predicted outcomes, and realized consequences.
- This supports a boundary condition in REE where error semantics change after commitment/action execution.
- Supports dual-channel interpretation (`MECH-060`) and commit-boundary attribution framing (`MECH-061`).

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Not a direct architectural proposal for tokenized commitment interfaces.
- Integrates multiple paradigms with heterogeneous operational definitions of agency.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.69`
- Rationale: broad and high-quality synthesis with strong conceptual fit, but indirect mapping to token contract fields.
