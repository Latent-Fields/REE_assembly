# Summary

## Source wording
Aston-Jones and Cohen (2005) frame LC-NE as an adaptive-gain system that reconfigures behavioral mode under changing demands.

## REE translation
This maps to a dedicated arousal/interrupt control axis in REE, not reducible to a single reward-precision scalar.

## Mapping caveat
The paper does not directly specify how many total orthogonal axes are required for full control-plane sufficiency.
