# Summary

## Source wording
Yu and Dayan (2005) argue uncertainty handling is decomposed across neuromodulatory signals rather than represented by one generic error channel.

## REE translation
This supports Q-017: REE should preserve multiple control-plane axes (for example precision, interrupt, persistence) with partial independence.

## Mapping caveat
The result is not a complete connectome map of all axis pathways, so REE still needs explicit architectural boundary tests.
