# Summary

## Source wording
Cools and D'Esposito (2011) show dopamine-related control effects are nonlinear and state-dependent rather than uniformly beneficial.

## REE translation
This supports Q-017 with explicit guardrails: a precision/vigor axis needs bounded operating regimes and context gating.

## Mapping caveat
Nonlinearity in one axis does not by itself settle the full minimal-axis decomposition.
