# Summary

## Source wording
Marder (2012) emphasizes neuromodulatory degeneracy and context-sensitive circuit effects, cautioning against rigid one-signal-one-function mappings.

## REE translation
This yields a mixed verdict for Q-017: keep control axes, but model them as partially coupled and context-conditioned.

## Mapping caveat
The review is broad and does not directly test REE-style control-plane optimization criteria.
