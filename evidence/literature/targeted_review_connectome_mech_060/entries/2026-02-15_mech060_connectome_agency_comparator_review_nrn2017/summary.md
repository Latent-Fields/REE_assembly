# Summary

## Source wording
Haggard (2017) reviews comparator-based agency signals that evaluate predicted versus observed action consequences.

## REE translation
This supports MECH-060 by grounding post-commit attributable mismatch channels after commitment/action.

## Mapping caveat
Comparator accounts do not fully specify multi-module credit assignment timescales, which remains an REE design choice.
