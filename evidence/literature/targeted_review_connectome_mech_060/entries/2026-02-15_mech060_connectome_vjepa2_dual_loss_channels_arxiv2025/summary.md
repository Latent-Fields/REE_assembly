# Summary

## Source wording
V-JEPA2 uses separate objective channels across immediate and rollout predictions in action-conditioned learning.

## REE translation
This provides mixed support for MECH-060: channel splitting is useful, but commitment-boundary accountability is still missing.

## Mapping caveat
The paper is an ML analogue, not direct biological/connectome evidence for pre/post-commit channel boundaries.
