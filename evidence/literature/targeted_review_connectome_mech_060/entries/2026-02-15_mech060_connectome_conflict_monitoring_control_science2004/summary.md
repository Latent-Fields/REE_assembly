# Summary

## Source wording
Botvinick et al. propose conflict monitoring signals to recruit control before stable response commitment.

## REE translation
This supports MECH-060 by backing a pre-commit evaluative channel distinct from post-commit responsibility updates.

## Mapping caveat
Evidence is strongest for monitoring/control recruitment, not full causal separation of all downstream attribution channels.
