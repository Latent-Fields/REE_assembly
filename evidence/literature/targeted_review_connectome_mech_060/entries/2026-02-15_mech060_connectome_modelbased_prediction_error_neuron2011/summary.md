# Summary

## Source wording
Daw et al. show striatal prediction-error signals carry outcome-linked updates with model-based influence.

## REE translation
This supports MECH-060 post-commit channels for attributable learning, with explicit allowance for blended components.

## Mapping caveat
The evidence implies separation is conditional and partial, not perfectly orthogonal in all contexts.
