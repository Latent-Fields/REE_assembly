# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech900_reproducible_computational_science_science2011

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-900`

## Source

- Peng RD (2011), *Reproducible Research in Computational Science*.
- URL: `https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1213847`

## Mapping to REE

- Supports the requirement that computational evidence should be auditable and reproducible.
- Aligns with MECH-900 trajectory-integrity process requirements around stable artifact trails and replayable conditions.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Methodological source, not a mechanistic model of neural computation.
- Improves evidence-process confidence more than mechanism-specific confidence.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.74`
- Rationale: high-quality reproducibility guidance with direct process-level relevance to integrity-focused evidence handling.
