# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech063_lcne_adaptive_gain_annurev2005

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-063`
- `MECH-040`
- `Q-017`

## Source

- Aston-Jones G, Cohen JD (2005), *An integrative theory of locus coeruleus-norepinephrine function: adaptive gain and optimal performance*.
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.neuro.28.061604.135709`

## Mapping to REE

- Provides explicit tonic/phasic mode structure with distinct control consequences.
- Supports REE requirement for non-collapsed control channels and for separating baseline state from volatility/interrupt response.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Source is centered on LC-NE axis and does not by itself justify all REE control axes.
- Translation to implementation-level module readout weights remains a design step.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.81`
- Rationale: high-quality theory with direct relevance to tonic/phasic control decomposition.
