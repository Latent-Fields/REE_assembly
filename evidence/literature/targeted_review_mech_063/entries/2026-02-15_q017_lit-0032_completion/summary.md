## Claims Tested

- `Q-017`

## Source

- *Uncertainty, neuromodulation, and attention*
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.04.026`

## Proposal Link

- proposal_id: `LIT-0032`
- literature_type: `targeted_review_mech_063`

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.79`
- rationale: Provides direct theoretical separation of distinct uncertainty/control functions across neuromodulatory systems, supporting REE orthogonal control-axis decomposition. Follow-up extraction scoped to Q-017 uncertainty-sensitive control allocation. Proposal completion extraction for LIT-0032 scoped to Q-017.
