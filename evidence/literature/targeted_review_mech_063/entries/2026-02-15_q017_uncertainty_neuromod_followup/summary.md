# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_q017_uncertainty_neuromod_followup

## Claims Tested

- `Q-017`

## Source

- Peter Dayan et al. (2005), *Uncertainty, neuromodulation, and attention*.
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.04.026`

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `Q-017` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to Q-017 uncertainty-sensitive control allocation.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.79`
- Rationale: Provides direct theoretical separation of distinct uncertainty/control functions across neuromodulatory systems, supporting REE orthogonal control-axis decomposition. Follow-up extraction scoped to Q-017 uncertainty-sensitive control allocation.
