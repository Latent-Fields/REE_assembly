## Claims Tested

- `MECH-040`

## Source

- Gary Aston-Jones et al. (2005), *An integrative theory of locus coeruleus-norepinephrine function: adaptive gain and optimal performance*.

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `MECH-040` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-040 arousal/interrupt modulation dynamics.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.81`
- Rationale: Strong evidence for separable tonic and phasic noradrenergic modes with distinct control effects, directly supporting REE tonic/phasic axis decomposition and volatility/readiness separation. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-040 arousal/interrupt modulation dynamics.
