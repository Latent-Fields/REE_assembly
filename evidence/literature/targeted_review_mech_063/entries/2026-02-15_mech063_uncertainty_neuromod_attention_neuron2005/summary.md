# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech063_uncertainty_neuromod_attention_neuron2005

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-063`
- `Q-017`

## Source

## Mapping to REE

- Distinguishes computational roles for different neuromodulatory channels under uncertainty.
- Supports REE orthogonal control-axis design and argues against scalar-collapse control.
- Provides direct theoretical motivation for `Q-017` (minimal axis subset preserving regime separation).

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Focused on uncertainty and attention, not full REE social/energy axes.
- Does not define tonic/phasic telemetry interface fields.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.79`
- Rationale: strong computational-theory fit with moderate extension gap to full REE control-plane inventory.
