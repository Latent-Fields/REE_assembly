# Summary

## Source wording
Default-network activity can couple with frontoparietal control systems during goal-directed cognition.

## REE translation
Mixed for MECH-029: reflective lanes should be conditionally gated, not assumed to be always segregated from goal-directed control.

## Mapping caveat
Coupling evidence is task-dependent and does not remove the need for strict commitment boundaries.
