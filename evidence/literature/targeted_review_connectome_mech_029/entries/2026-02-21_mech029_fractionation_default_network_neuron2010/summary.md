# Summary

## Source wording
The default network is functionally and anatomically fractionated into distinct subsystems.

## REE translation
Supports MECH-029 by encouraging decomposed reflective replay pathways with explicit integration constraints.

## Mapping caveat
Subsystem structure does not by itself specify commitment suppression thresholds.
