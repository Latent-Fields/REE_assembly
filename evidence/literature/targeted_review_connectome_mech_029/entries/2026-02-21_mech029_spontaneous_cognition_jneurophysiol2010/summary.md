# Summary

## Source wording
Default-network subsystems are differentially associated with spontaneous thought and internally directed cognition.

## REE translation
Supports MECH-029 by favoring structured reflective replay lanes over a single undifferentiated DMN process.

## Mapping caveat
Subsystem association evidence does not directly encode commitment gating boundaries.
