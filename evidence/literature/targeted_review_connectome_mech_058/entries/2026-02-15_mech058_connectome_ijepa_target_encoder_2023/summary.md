# Summary

## Source wording
I-JEPA uses asymmetric context-to-target embedding prediction to learn semantically meaningful representations.

## REE translation
This supports MECH-058 by reinforcing target-anchor asymmetry as a stabilizing design motif.

## Mapping caveat
The paper does not directly evaluate long-horizon policy shifts or stress-regime collapse behavior.
