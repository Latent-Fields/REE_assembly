# Summary

## Source wording
The analysis indicates collapse avoidance comes from asymmetry plus optimization dynamics, not one unique mechanism.

## REE translation
This supports a narrowed MECH-058 hybrid claim: retain target-anchor separation as core but enforce explicit guardrails and bounded scope.

## Mapping caveat
Evidence remains primarily algorithmic and needs REE-specific stress testing for architectural promotion.
