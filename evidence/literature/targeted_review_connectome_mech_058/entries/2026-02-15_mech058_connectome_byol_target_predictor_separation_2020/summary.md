# Summary

## Source wording
BYOL reports stable self-supervised learning with online-predictor and slow-target asymmetry.

## REE translation
This supports MECH-058: EMA-like anchor separation is a viable stabilization mechanism for predictive substrates.

## Mapping caveat
The evidence is algorithmic and does not by itself validate biological-connectome instantiation choices.
