# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_arc018_future_path_replay_followup

## Claims Tested

- `ARC-018`

## Source

- Bradley E. Pfeiffer et al. (2013), *Hippocampal place-cell sequences depict future paths to remembered goals*.
- URL: `https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12112`

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `ARC-018` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to ARC-018 path-rollout grounding using goal-directed replay evidence.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.79`
- Rationale: Direct in vivo evidence that hippocampal sequential activity at decision points sweeps toward goal locations; strong support for rollout/path-evaluation roles but indirect for REE-specific residue geometry. Follow-up extraction scoped to ARC-018 path-rollout grounding using goal-directed replay evidence.
