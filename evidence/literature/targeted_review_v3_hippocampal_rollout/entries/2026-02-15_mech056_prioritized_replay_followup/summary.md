# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech056_prioritized_replay_followup

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-056`

## Source

- Marcelo G. Mattar et al. (2018), *Prioritized memory access explains planning and hippocampal replay*.
- URL: `https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0232-z`

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `MECH-056` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-056 replay-prioritization and planning coupling.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.73`
- Rationale: The prioritized replay account reproduces multiple replay signatures and links replay selection to gain/need-like utility, consistent with precision-weighted rollout selection; evidence remains model-based and indirect for dual commit channels. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-056 replay-prioritization and planning coupling.
