## Claims Tested

- `MECH-056`

## Mapping to REE

- The study finds prospective sequence construction toward reward locations before direct exploration of those paths.
- This supports `MECH-056` because trajectory candidates appear to be organized first, with downstream representational detail filled in later during experience.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- The evidence concerns spatial reward navigation and does not directly measure REE residue placement operators.
- The experiment does not test representational distortion metrics, so trajectory-first ordering is inferred from temporal sequence structure.
- Translation from hippocampal sequence content to abstract latent substrate edits remains open.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.69`
- Rationale: clear prospective sequence effect aligned with trajectory-first interpretation, with notable abstraction gap to REE residue geometry internals.
