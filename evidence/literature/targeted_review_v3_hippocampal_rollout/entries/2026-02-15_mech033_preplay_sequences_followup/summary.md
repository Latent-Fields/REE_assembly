# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech033_preplay_sequences_followup

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-033`

## Source

- George Dragoi et al. (2011), *Preplay of future place cell sequences by hippocampal cellular assemblies*.
- URL: `https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09633`

## Mapping to REE

- Claim-scoped follow-up extraction for `MECH-033` using prior vetted source material.
- Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-033 prospective sequence generation evidence.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.74`
- Rationale: Demonstrates preconfigured sequence chaining before novel traversal, supporting a hippocampal kernel-chaining interface hypothesis; mapping to explicit REE predictor APIs is still indirect. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-033 prospective sequence generation evidence.
