# Literature Summary: 2026-02-15_mech056_lit-0014_completion

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-056`

## Source

- *Prioritized memory access explains planning and hippocampal replay*
- URL: `https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0232-z`

## Proposal Link

- proposal_id: `LIT-0014`
- literature_type: `targeted_review_v3_hippocampal_rollout`

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.73`
- rationale: The prioritized replay account reproduces multiple replay signatures and links replay selection to gain/need-like utility, consistent with precision-weighted rollout selection; evidence remains model-based and indirect for dual commit channels. Follow-up extraction scoped to MECH-056 replay-prioritization and planning coupling. Proposal completion extraction for LIT-0014 scoped to MECH-056.
