# Summary

## Source wording
Response inhibition recruits both hyperdirect and indirect fronto-basal ganglia pathways.

## REE translation
Supports MECH-026 as coordinated restraint circuitry for vigilance without commitment release.

## Mapping caveat
Stopping-task evidence is narrower than full continuous vigilance contexts.
