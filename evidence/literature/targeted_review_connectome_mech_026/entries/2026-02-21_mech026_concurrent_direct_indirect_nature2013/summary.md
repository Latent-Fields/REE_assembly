# Summary

## Source wording
Direct and indirect striatal pathways are concurrently active during action initiation.

## REE translation
Mixed for MECH-026: restraint and release pathways can overlap dynamically, so vigilance should be modeled as biased coupling, not strict channel isolation.

## Mapping caveat
Movement-initiation paradigms do not fully capture broader vigilant monitoring contexts.
