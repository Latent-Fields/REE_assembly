# Summary: MECH-054 literature extraction

## Source

Matsumoto M, Hikosaka O. *Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.* Nature (2007). doi:10.1038/nature05860.

## Claim linkage

- claim_id: `MECH-054`
- direction: `supports`

## Why it matters for REE

This paper provides direct evidence that a lateral-habenula pathway carries negative-value signals that shape dopaminergic responses. In REE terms, this supports preserving signed harm/benefit-sensitive precision routing rather than collapsing value-sign and confidence effects into a single unsigned residual stream.

## Caveat

The source constrains sign-sensitive control semantics, but does not itself determine full REE axis decomposition or implementation contracts.
