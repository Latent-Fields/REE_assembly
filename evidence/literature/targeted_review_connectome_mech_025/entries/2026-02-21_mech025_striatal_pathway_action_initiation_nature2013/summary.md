# Summary

## Source wording
Direct and indirect striatal pathways are coactive around action initiation.

## REE translation
Supports MECH-025 by grounding action-mode enaction in coordinated gating rather than a simplistic single release path.

## Mapping caveat
Cross-species transfer and cognitive-level interpretation must be bounded.
