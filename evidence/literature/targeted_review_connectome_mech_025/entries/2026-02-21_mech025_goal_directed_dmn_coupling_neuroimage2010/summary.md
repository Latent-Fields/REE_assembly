# Summary

## Source wording
Goal-directed cognition can engage cooperative coupling between default-network and frontoparietal control systems.

## REE translation
Mixed for MECH-025: action mode should not enforce blanket DMN suppression; conditional cooperative coupling can be functional.

## Mapping caveat
Coupling depends on task structure and does not remove the need for commitment gating.
