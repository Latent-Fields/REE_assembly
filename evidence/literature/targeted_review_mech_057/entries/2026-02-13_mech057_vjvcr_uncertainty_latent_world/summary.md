## Mapping to REE

- Strengthens evidence that JEPA-style models can represent high-level video dynamics and uncertainty in latent space.
- Provides substrate support for REE prediction layers but not a direct test of commitment/control arbitration.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- No direct embodied action loop or responsibility attribution benchmark.
- Control-plane necessity remains unresolved by this result.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `mixed`
- `confidence`: `0.60`
- Rationale: relevant representational support with limited control-plane evidence.
