# Literature Summary: 2026-02-13_mech057_ijepa_latent_prediction

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-057`

## Source

- Assran M et al. (2023), *Self-Supervised Learning from Images with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture*.
- URL: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08243`

## Mapping to REE

- Demonstrates that latent prediction in embedding space can produce strong semantic representations without pixel-space reconstruction.
- Supports the REE hypothesis that substantial E1/E2 machinery can be built from JEPA-style representational learning.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- This source is representational and pre-agentic.
- It does not test responsibility flow, commitment gating, or control-plane arbitration.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.72`
- Rationale: strong substrate evidence, limited direct evidence for control completion necessity.
