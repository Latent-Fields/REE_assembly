## Claims Tested

- `MECH-057`
- `Q-012`

## Source

## Mapping to REE

- Shows a concrete action-conditioned extension (V-JEPA 2-AC) and planning use in robotic settings.
- Strongly supports the claim that JEPA substrate tends toward added action/control machinery when scaled to agency.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Still does not isolate REE-style control-plane knobs (precision routing, residue gating) as causal factors.
- Evidence supports convergence pressure, not full equivalence.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.78`
- Rationale: direct agentic extension evidence with remaining control-plane attribution gap.
