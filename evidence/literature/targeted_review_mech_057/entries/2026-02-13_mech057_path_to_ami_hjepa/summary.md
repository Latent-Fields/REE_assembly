## Mapping to REE

- Describes H-JEPA as a world-model component within a broader architecture including planning and actor pathways.
- Supports the REE framing that latent representation machinery is necessary but may require additional control/action layers in autonomous settings.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Position/notes paper rather than controlled embodied benchmark evidence.
- Does not provide direct falsification against REE-style responsibility loops.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.69`
- Rationale: strong conceptual alignment, moderate empirical specificity.
