# Literature Summary: 2026-02-13_mech057_vljepa_multimodal_world_model

## Claims Tested

- `MECH-057`

## Source

- Chen D et al. (2025), *VL-JEPA: Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Vision-language*.
- URL: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10942`

## Mapping to REE

- Demonstrates JEPA-style predictive embeddings can scale to multimodal vision-language settings with selective decoding.
- Supports the idea that REE can inherit substantial substrate machinery from JEPA-family world models.

## Caveats and Mapping Limits

- Multimodal representational strength does not itself establish responsibility-flow or trajectory-gating requirements.

## Direction and Confidence

- `evidence_direction`: `supports`
- `confidence`: `0.65`
- Rationale: broad substrate support with indirect link to control-plane claims.
