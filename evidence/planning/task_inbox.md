# Task Inbox

Use this as the low-friction capture surface.

- Add new work as `- [ ] task`.
- Mark complete as `- [x] task` (exact same text).
- `run_governance_cycle.py` syncs this file into `manual_carryover_items.v1.json` automatically.
- Completed checkbox lines are removed automatically on sync (use `--no-prune-completed` to keep them).

## Tasks

- Add tasks below this line using checkbox format.
