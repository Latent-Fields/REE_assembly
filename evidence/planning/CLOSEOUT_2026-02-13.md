# Governance Closeout - 2026-02-13

Scope: close today's governance cycle with explicit done/carry-forward state.

## Checkpoint Status

1. Thought intake
- `done`
- `docs/thoughts/thought_sweep.v1.json` reports `unprocessed=0`.

2. Conflict resolution discussion
- `done (discussion + decisions logged)`
- Both active conflicts remain evidence-open:
  - `MECH-056` directional conflict ratio `0.8`
  - `Q-011` directional conflict ratio `1.0`
- Source: `evidence/experiments/conflicts.md`.

3. Governance decisions
- `done`
- `MECH-056`: approved hold (`hold_candidate_resolve_conflict`).
- `Q-011`: demoted `active -> candidate`, then approved hold as candidate.
- Sources:
  - `docs/claims/claims.yaml`
  - `evidence/decisions/decision_log.v1.jsonl`
  - `evidence/decisions/decision_state.v1.json`

4. Evidence dispatch
- `partially completed today`
- Completed:
  - Experimental runs ingested for `EXP-0003` and `EXP-0005`.
  - Literature entries added for `LIT-0004` and `LIT-0006`.
- Remaining high-priority dispatch items still generated by criteria:
  - `EXP-0001` (`MECH-053`, ree-v1-minimal)
  - `EXP-0002` (`MECH-054`, ree-v1-minimal)
- Source: `evidence/planning/experiment_proposals.v1.json`.

5. Maintenance
- `done`
- `unlinked_evidence_runs=0`, `warnings=0`.

## Carry Forward to Next Cycle

1. Adjudicate `MECH-056` and `Q-011` conflicts with tighter experiment design
- Use narrower stop criteria and replication/seed sweep.

2. Execute missing experimental evidence for `MECH-053` and `MECH-054`
- Dispatch `EXP-0001` and `EXP-0002` to `ree-v1-minimal`.

3. Re-run ingestion and governance cycle
- `python3 evidence/experiments/scripts/build_experiment_indexes.py`
- `python3 evidence/planning/scripts/run_governance_cycle.py`
